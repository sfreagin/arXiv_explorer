Usua l 4d Ein-\\nstein gravity plus a topological term (the ”Born-Infeld” La grangian\\nfor gravity), is shown to be obtained by a generalized dimens ional\\nreduction from 5d Chern-Simons gravity. Chern-Simons grav ity in\\nd=2n+1 is dimensionally reduced to CS gravity in d=2n-1 via a\\nmechanism similar to descent equations. The consistency of the\\ndimensional reduction in both cases is analyzed. The dimens ional\\nreductionofd=2n+2Born-Infeldgravitytod=2nBIgravity, aswell\\nas d=2n BI gravity to d=2n-1 CS gravity is hard to achieve. Thu s\\n4d gravity (plus a topological term) can be embedded into d=2 n+1\\nCS gravity, including 11d CS, whose supersymmetric version could\\npossibly be related to usual 11d supergravity. This raises t he hope\\nthat maybe 4d quantum Einstein gravity could be embedded in a\\nwell deﬁned quantum theory, similar to Witten’s treatment o f 3d\\nquantum Einstein gravity as a CS theory.\\n∗email: nastase@phys.titech.ac.jp\\n1\\n1 Introduction\\nDimensional reduction as a tool for quantum ﬁeld theory started w ith the idea of Kaluza and\\nKlein to use 5d Einstein gravity (in the usual, metric, formulation) and obtain uniﬁcation\\nin 4d of gravity with electromagnetism. The inverse process (”dimen sional oxidation”) has\\nbeen used to simplify quantum ﬁeld theories and supergravity theor ies alike, for example\\nshowing that the complicated N=8 supergravity in 4d can be embedde d into the simple and\\nunique N=1 supergravity in 11d. When one does this however, the qu antum structure of\\nthe theory gets more problematic (see for example [1, 2] showing th at although 4d N=8\\nsupergravity shows evidence of fewer or possibly no divergencies, 11d supergravity has a\\nmore complicated divergence structure). In supergravity, the g ravity formulation in terms of\\nvielbein or spin connection is more fundamental than the metric one ( in particular in one of\\nthe ﬁrst, second, or 1.5 order formulations [3]). Yet still, when one t alks about dimensional\\nreduction, oneadoptsaformulationthatmimicsthecaseofthemet ricformulationofgravity:\\nﬁnd a background with a geometrical interpretation (e.g. torus, o r sphere), expand around\\nit in spherical harmonics, and keep only the lowest mass multiplet in the expansion.\\nHowever, this need not a priori be the case. In a famous paper [4], f ollowing earlier work\\nin [5, 6], Witten showed that following the metric version of the theory too closely one can\\nmiss important facts. In particular, he noticed that 3d gravity is a C hern-Simons theory,\\nthus a gauge theory for the Poincare group, with gauge ﬁelds ea\\nµandωab\\nµ. As such, it can\\nbe quantized by treating it as a theory on an abstract space, with t he vielbein and spin\\nconnection being just regular ﬁelds, with the natural background value of zero, instead of\\nthe natural background value of ea\\nµ=δa\\nµ,ωab\\nµ= 0 of ﬂat space, borrowed from the metric\\nformulation. Although the 3d Einstein gravity is a gauge theory of CS type, the 4d Einstein\\ngravity is not (the Lagrangian is not gauge invariant, or rather it is o nly gauge invariant on\\nshell, and by identifying the base manifold with the tangent space, i.e. diﬀeomorphisms with\\ngauge transformations).\\nIn this paper, I will try to analyze the case of 4d gravity in the vielbein -spin connection\\nformulation,andembeditinhigherdimensions, similarlywithoutprecon ceivednotionsabout\\nhow dimensional reduction should look like. We will see that in fact one c an now improve\\nthe behaviour of the 4d quantum gravity by adding a topological ter m and embedding\\nthe resulting Lagrangian (”Born-Infeld” gravity) in 2n+1 dimension al Chern-Simons gravity\\ntheories, whichthemselves canbeembedded in2n+2dimensional top ologicaltheories. While\\nI will not attempt to deﬁne the quantum version of the Chern-Simon s gravities, or to see how\\nit relates to the 4d quantum gravity, it is conceivable that such a tre atment will be possible\\nalong the lines of Witten’s analysis. After this paper was ﬁnished, I be came aware of [7],\\nwhich deals with the dimensional reduction of Lovelock-type actions , but from a diﬀerent\\npoint of view (and with diﬀerent aims and results) as this paper, and t he related work [8]\\nwhich deals with some Chern-Simons gravity theories and their relatio n to Lovelock gravity\\nin odd dimensions.\\nIwillstartinsection2withanembeddingthatIhadalreadyarguedfo rin[9]. Speciﬁcally,\\nI will argue that Chern-Simons gravity in d=2n+1 can be reduced to B orn-Infeld gravity\\nin d=2n, via a natural extension of the usual dimensional reduction of the Einstein-Hilbert\\n2\\naction. I will analyze the dimensional reduction in more detail, and spe cialize for the case\\nof n=2 (d=4 gravity, of the type of Einstein action plus a topological term). In section 3 I\\nwill show that it is possible to go from CS gravity in d=2n+1 to CS gravity in d=2n-1, via\\na generalized notion of dimensional reduction, with the 2n+1 to 2n re duction not having a\\ngeometric analog, while from 2n to 2n-1 one just goes to the bounda ry theory, the whole\\nsequence being a generalized version of descent equations. In sec tion 4 I will attempt to do\\ngo from d=2n+2 Born-Infeld gravity to d=2n BI gravity and from BI to CS gravity, and I\\nwill see that it is not easy, but I will write down conditions that if satisﬁ ed, will lead to a\\nsuccessful dimensional reduction. In section 5 I will discuss about the possible relations to\\n11d supergravity and topological theories, and conclude.\\n2 From 5d Chern-Simons to 4d Einstein gravity\\nIn the vielbein-spin connection formulation of gravity, the gravitat ional action is written in\\na form mimicking gauge theories, via the curvature 2-form\\nRab(ω) =dωab+ωac∧ωcb(2.1)\\nThe Einstein action is then written as a gauge theory action with the g auge group being\\nthe Poincare group ISO(d-1,1) and the gauge ﬁelds ωab(forJab) andea\\nµ(forPa). In 4d the\\nEinstein action is\\nSEH=/integraldisplay\\nd4xǫabcdRab(ω)∧ec∧ed(2.2)\\nin a ﬁrst order formulation, since by varying with respect to ωabone gets the vielbein con-\\nstraint,Ta=Dea= 0. Of course, this is not a Yang-Mills action, since it is not of a gauge\\ninvariant form (it is of the type ( dA+A∧A)∧A∧A), and it is only invariant on-shell (if\\nTa=Dea= 0), and if one identiﬁes local translations in the base space (diﬀeom orphisms\\nwith parameter λµ) with local translations in the tangent space (gauge transformat ions with\\nparameter λa) via the inverse vielbein eµ\\na, asλµ=eµ\\naλa.\\nBut in 3 dimensions, the Einstein action is gauge invariant, being a Cher n-Simons theory,\\nSEH=/integraldisplay\\nM3=∂M4ǫabcRab(ω)∧ec=/integraldisplay\\nM4ǫabcRab(ω)∧Tc(2.3)\\nthus being of the type/integraltext\\nM4FA∧FBdAB, withRab(ω) andTcbeing the curvatures of the 3d\\nPoincare group and ǫabcthe symmetric group invariant dAB. Witten noted this and used it\\nto deﬁne the quantum theory of 3d gravity [4].\\nOne can introduce a cosmological constant λ/3 by adding a term to the action\\nS=SEH+λ\\n3/integraldisplay\\nd3xǫabcea∧eb∧ec(2.4)\\nThe action is then invariant under the de Sitter (SO(3,1)) or Anti-de Sitter (SO(2,2))\\ngroup, depending on the sign of λ. In the following we will assume that λis positive, thus\\n3\\nconsidering the AdS group. The invariance can be easily seen by rewr iting the action in\\nmanifestly invariant form,\\nS=/integraldisplay\\nM3=∂M4(Rab∧ec+λ\\n3ea∧eb∧ec)ǫabc=/integraldisplay\\nM4¯Rab∧Tcǫabc (2.5)\\nwhere\\n¯Rab=Rab(ω)+λea∧eb(2.6)\\nis the curvature of the SO(2,2) gauge ﬁeld A=ωabJab+eaPa=ωabJab+ ˜ea˜Paandea,Pa\\nare quantities rescaled by M=√\\nλ(ea= ˜ea/M,P a=M˜Pa), so that now for instance,\\n[Pa,Pb] =M2Jab=λJab. The Wigner-Inonu contraction M→0 takes us to the previous\\ncase of the Poincare group.\\nIn higher odd dimensions d=2n+1, one can deﬁne generalizations of t he gravitational\\nChern-Simons action for the SO(2n,2) group (in the presence of λ), by\\nS=/integraldisplay\\nM2n+1=∂M2n+2ICS,2n+1=/integraldisplay\\nM2n+2¯Ra1a2∧...∧¯Ra2n−1a2n∧Ta2n+1ǫa1...a2n+1(2.7)\\nHere again the epsilon tensor ǫa1...a2n+1takes the role of the symmetric tensor dA1..An+1\\n(=Tr(TA1...TAn+1) in the corresponding representation).

They are the unique cases in their dimension f or which the LL action\\ndoes not generate more constraints by acting with covariant deriv atives on the equations of\\nmotion.\\nThe uniqueness of the BI and CS actions make us hope that they can be obtained from\\neach other via dimensional reduction. As noted in [9], it is pretty obvio us how to do this in\\nthe case of reducing CS to BI.\\n4\\nOne generalizes the dimensional reduction of the usual metric form ulation of Einstein\\ngravity (and the corresponding supergravity method for the vielb ein-spin connection formu-\\nlation) to the case of CS gravity. The usual case of Kaluza-Klein (dim ensional reduction of\\n5d gravity to 4d gravity + gauge ﬁeld + scalar) has the metric reduct ion ansatz\\ngΛΠ=φ−1/3/parenleftbigggµν+φAµAνφAµ\\nφAνφ/parenrightbigg\\n(2.10)\\nand as is well known one cannot put φto 1 unless Aµis also zero, otherwise the truncation is\\ninconsistent, i.e. it doesn’t satisfy the equations of motion. In term s of the vielbein EA\\nΛ, that\\nmeansthat EA\\n5canbeputtozerobyachoiceofgauge, E5\\n5=φ1/3isascalar, Ea\\nµ= (E5\\n5)−1/2ea\\nµ\\nwithea\\nµthe 4d vielbein, and E5\\nµ=AµE5\\n5completes the reduction ansatz. So if one puts E5\\n5\\nto 1 and Aµto zero, that is a consistent trucation. In a ﬁrst order formulatio n, with the spin\\nconnection independent of the vielbein, one would have to put also ωa5\\nµandωAB\\n5to zero.\\nHere and in the following, when we dimensionally reduce we dentote by Λ ,Π,...higher\\ndimensional curved indices, by µ,ν,...lower dimensional curved indices, by A,B,...higher\\ndimensional ﬂat (group) indices, and by a,b,...lower dimensional ﬂat (group) indices.\\nOne then can generalize this KK reduction to the case of CS gravity, again choosing a\\ngauge so that EA\\n5= 0 and putting E5\\n5to 1 and the gauge ﬁeld Ea\\nµto zero, and see what we\\nget. It is easy to see that on the action, this procedure is equivalen t to varying the action\\nwith respect to e5\\n5(and then putting δe5\\n5to 1). As a result, the reduced Lagrangian is the\\nsame as the equation of motion for e5\\n5in the KK reduction background. As before, one puts\\nalsoωa5\\nµandωAB\\n5to zero.\\nThis KK reduction can be trivially be extended to arbitrary n, by putt inge2n+1\\n2n+1=cand\\nthe rest of the extra dimensional ﬁelds to zero. Then one obtains t hatα′\\npbecomes αpby\\ndimensional reduction, so that the CS action in d=2n+1 is dimensionally reduced to the BI\\naction in d=2n.\\nThis procedure is a generalization of the usual KK reduction also bec ause gravity is just\\na gauge ﬁeld here, and the action is deﬁned without the need of the in verse vielbein or the\\nstar operation, thus is quasi-topological (it is genuinely topological in one dimension higher):\\nit could actually be deﬁned on an auxiliary space with a diﬀerent metric!\\nMore importantly however, now, even though we have put both the gauge ﬁeld to zero\\nand the scalar to one, we still have a truncation that is generically inc onsistent. Speciﬁcally,\\nwe need to satisfy the equations of motion of the ﬁelds that were pu t to zero: consistency\\nof the truncation means that the lower dimensional equations of mo tion need to satisfy the\\nhigher dimensional equations of motion.\\nIn the KK reduction background, we have ( ¯Ra5)µν=T5= 0 (but ¯Ra5\\nµ5=λcea\\nµ/negationslash= 0), as\\nwell as¯Rab\\nµ5=Ta\\nµ5= 0. That can be easily seen to imply the ea\\n5andωab\\n5equations of motion,\\nas well as the e5\\nµandωa5\\nµequations of motion. But the e5\\n5andωa5\\n5equations of motion are\\nnot automatically satisﬁed, and give instead (making an obvious gene ralization to d=2n+1\\ninstead of d=5 that carries through trivially)\\nǫa1...a2n¯Ra1a2∧...∧¯Ra2n−1a2n= 0\\nǫa1...a2n¯Ra1a2∧...∧¯Ra2n−3a2n−2∧Ta2n−1= 0 (2.11)\\n5\\nrespectively. The ﬁrst one says that the BI action in 2n dimensions is zero on-shell (which\\nwas to be expected, since as mentioned the dimensional reduction o f the action is equivalent\\nto varying with respect to ed\\nd, or theed\\ndequation of motion), and the second can be seen to\\nbe satisﬁed by Ta= 0, thus if we go to a second order formulation. However, for cons istency\\nof the reduction, the question is whether the BI equation of motion ,\\nǫa1...a2n¯Ra1a2∧...∧¯Ra2n−5a2n−4∧Ta2n−3∧ea2n−2= 0\\nǫa1...a2n¯Ra1a2∧...∧¯Ra2n−3a2n−2∧ea2n−1= 0 (2.12)\\nsatisfy the above conditions. For general d=2n, even Ta= 0 is not the most general solution\\nof theωab\\nµequation above, so in general neither of the conditions in (2.11) are satisﬁed and\\nthe reduction is generically inconsistent.\\nLet us now go back to the case of interest, of n=2, thus 5d CS going to 4d BI gravity. In\\n4d, BI gravity has the action\\n/integraldisplay\\nd4x¯Rab∧¯Rcdǫabcd=λ/integraldisplay\\nd4xǫabcd(1\\nλRab∧Rcd+2Rab∧ec∧ed+λea∧eb∧ec∧ed) =Stop+SEH+Sλ\\n(2.13)\\nthus is just the Einstein action, with a cosmological constant term, and a topological term\\nadded (the Euler density), that will not aﬀect the equations of mot ion! In fact, this exact\\ntopological term that takes Einstein gravity with Λ into BI gravity, c an be argued to be\\nneeded for a variety of reasons. For instance, its addition regular izes Noether charges, and\\ndeﬁnes a well posed boundary condition for locally AdS spacetimes, t hus containing a built-\\nin regularization [17] (a similar situation is shown there to be true in high er dimensions, and\\nother quantities are also ﬁxed by the addition of the topological ter m).\\nSo at least at the classical level, the 5d CS action has a KK reduction b ackground that\\nreduces the theory to usual Einstein gravity! Unfortunately, as we saw, we need to satisfy\\nthe conditions (2.11) for consistency of the reduction. However, in 4d,Ta= 0 (which solves\\nthe second equation in (2.11)) is the most general solution of the ωab\\nµBI equation of motion,\\nso the second condition is satisﬁed now. But to satisfy the ﬁrst con dition we need also to\\nhave the BI action equal to zero on-shell. Using the Einstein’s equat ion (theea\\nµBI equation\\nof motion), the ﬁrst consistency condition (of zero BI Lagrangian ) becomes\\nǫabcd(Rab∧Rcd−λ2ea∧eb∧ec∧ed) = 0 (2.14)\\nwhich integrated, would be λ2×volume=topological number .\\nSo the KK reduction from 5d CS to 4d BI is still inconsistent, but now t he only remain-\\ning consistency condition has a simple interpretation. Still, it is not ver y nice to have a\\ntruncation be consistent only on a subset of the theory, so it would be very useful to ﬁnd out\\nif there is a consistent truncation. Whenever one has an inconsiste nt truncation in dimen-\\nsional reduction, there are 2 possible ways out: it may be possible to construct a nonlinear\\nredeﬁnition of ﬁelds that gives a consistent truncation (like for inst ance in the case of the S4\\nandS7reductions of 11d supergravity to gauged supergravities in 7d and 4d, respectively\\n[18, 19]). Or one may need to keep more ﬁelds, like in the case of the or iginal Kaluza-Klein\\nreduction described before: keeping only Aµand notφis inconsistent, but by adding φthe\\n6\\nKK reduction is consistent. Most known cases conform to either on e of these situations, so\\nit would be worthwhile exploring whether a nonlinear redeﬁnition of ﬁeld s, or allowing for\\nmore ﬁelds in the theory will make the KK reduction consistent, but w e will leave it for\\nfurther work.\\nA hint that a nonlinear redeﬁnition of ﬁelds making the truncation con sistent is possible\\ncomes from the work of Chamseddine [20] (see also the discussion in [9 ] for more details).\\nOur ansatz has e5\\n5=c,ea\\n5=ωab\\n5= 0,e5\\nµ=ωa5\\nµ= 0, implying ¯Ra5\\nµν=T5= 0,¯Rab\\nµ5=Ta\\nµ5= 0,\\n¯Ra5\\nµ5=λcea\\nµ(and one needs (2.14) for consistency of the reduction). Chamse ddine proved\\nthat the 5d CS gravity action has a classical background, satisfyin ge5\\n0;5=c,ea\\n0;5=ωab\\n0;5= 0,\\ne5\\n0;µ=ωa5\\n0;µ= 0, that implies ¯Ra5\\n0;µν=T5\\n0= 0,¯Rab\\n0;µ5=Ta\\n0;µ5= 0,¯Ra5\\n0;µ5=λcea\\n0;µ, but also\\nTa\\n0= 0,¯Rab\\n0= 0 (thus the background satisﬁes our condition (2.14) for consist ency of the\\nreduction). Around this classical background, ﬂuctuations have a quadratic action that is\\nexactly that of the 4d Einstein action with cosmological term, in eithe r theﬁrst or the second\\norder formulations. Since as we mentioned, the topological Euler de nsity doesn’t contribute\\nto the equations of motion, this is exactly what we expect from a con sistent truncation\\nextension of our ansatz. Moreover, in the Chamseddine backgrou nd, the ﬂuctuations for the\\nextra 5d ﬁelds drop out, so in eﬀect we have e5\\n5=c,ea\\n5=ωab\\n5= 0,e5\\nµ=ωa5\\nµ= 0 for the full\\nﬁelds, not only for the background, exactly as in our case. In conc lusion, this makes it likely\\nthat a consistent truncation extension of our ansatz can be foun d.\\n3 New dimensional reduction: from D=2n+1 CS to\\nD=2n-1 CS gravity via ”descent equations”\\nAs we saw in theprevious section, the CS gravity actionin d=2n+1 red uces to the BI gravity\\naction in d=2n by putting e2n+1\\n2n+1=cand all the rest of the extra dimensional ﬁelds to zero.\\nAt the level of the Lanczos-Lovelock-type action, CS gravity look s schematically like\\nL=/summationdisplay\\npα′\\np;n(R)∧p∧(e)∧(2n+1−2p);α′\\np;n=1\\n2n+1−2pn!\\np!(n−p)!(3.1)\\nand since as mentioned, the dimensional reduction is equivalent to va rying with respect to\\ne2n+1\\n2n+1(its equation of motion), the result is\\nL=/summationdisplay\\npαp;n(R)∧p∧(e)∧(2n−2p);αp;n=α′\\np;n(2n+1−2p) =n!\\np!(n−p)!(3.2)\\nwhich is BI gravity in d=2n. However, if we continue to dimensionally red uce in the same\\nway, by putting e2n\\n2n=cand the rest of the extra dimensional ﬁelds to zero, we do not get\\nthe CS theory in d=2n-1, but rather\\n˜αp;n−1= (2n−2p)αp;n= 2nαp;n−1/negationslash=α′\\np;n−1 (3.3)\\nthus a diﬀerent Lanczos-Lovelock Lagrangian in d=2n-1, which is sp eciﬁcally,\\n˜S= 2n/integraldisplay\\nd2n−1xǫa1...a2n−1¯Ra1a2∧...∧¯Ra2n−3a2n−2∧ea2n−1(3.4)\\n7\\nSo we cannot obtain a sequence of dimensional reductions CS→BI→CSas one\\nmight have suspected, but one may still ask whether one can still dim ensionally reduce the\\nCS action in d=2n+1 to a CS action in d=2n-1. Luckily, for that reduct ion there exist an\\nanalog for the dimensional reduction of usual CS gauge theories, t he ”descent equations”.\\nThe descent equations are usually written formally as ωD+2=dωD+1,δωD+1=dωD,\\nwhereωDisananomalyterminevendimensions, thatintegratedgivesanaction . Thismeans\\nthat one ”descends” (dimensionally reduces) from an anomaly term to another. Concretely,\\nfor a single gauge ﬁeld A with ﬁeld strength F=dA,dA= 0, one can consider the form\\nω2n+2=TrF∧(n+1). Because dω2n+2= 0, one can write locally ω2n+2=dω2n+1, withω2n+1\\nthe Chern-Simons form. Then, because δω2n+2= (n+1)dtr(δAFn), it means that δω2n+1=\\ntr(δAFn). Then, under a gauge transformation δA=DΛ, one obtains δgauge,Λω2n+1=\\ndtr(ΛFn), and upon eliminating Λ we get dω2n, which is as we mentioned what one usually\\nunderstands by descent equations.\\nBut we will instead understand it (for our purposes) as ω2n+2=dω2n+1,δω2n+1=\\ntr(δAFn), which equals ω2nif we put δA= 1. We can notice already the similarity to\\nwhat we did before, when we dimensionally reduced by putting eD\\nDto 1 and said that this is\\nthe same as varying with respect to eand putting the variation to 1.\\nHowever, this is not the whole story, as this formalism doesn’t apply a utomatically .\\nWe note that for dimensional reduction of gravity, we must also ”dim ensionally reduce”\\nthe gauge group, in this case the AdS group SO(d-1,2), and in the us ual descent equations\\nformalism the gauge group is maintained, so the analysis will not autom atically carry over,\\nwe have to deﬁne exactly at which step and how we reduce the gauge group. Moreover, in\\nour case, we have a choice of what gauge ﬁeld to use for δA= 1, either ea\\nµorωab\\nµ. In view\\nof the previous section, we might think using the vielbein is required, b ut in fact we will see\\nthat is not the case.\\nSo starting with the CS form (action) in d=2n+1, we want to put a gau ge ﬁeld to 1,\\nequivalent to varying A and putting δA= 1. Speciﬁcally, we put ω2n,2n+1\\n2n+1=cand the\\nrest of the extra-dimensional ﬁelds to zero, i.e. ωa,2n\\nΛ=ωa,2n+1\\nΛ= 0,e2n\\nΛ=e2n+1\\nΛ= 0,\\nω2n,2n+1\\nµ=ea\\n2n+1=ωab\\n2n+1= 0. It is then easy to check (as it should be obvious from the\\ndescent equations formalism above) that then the d=2n+1 CS grav ity action reduces in\\nd=2n to\\nS2n(M2n) =/integraldisplay\\nM2nd2nxǫa1....a2n−1¯Ra1a2∧...∧¯Ra2n−3a2n−2∧Ta2n−1\\n=/integraldisplay\\nM2nd2nxdICS,2n−1=/integraldisplay\\nM2n−1=∂M2nd2n−1xICS,2n+1=SCS,2n−1(M2n−1) (3.5)\\nthus a further dimensional reduction is obtained by just going to th e 2n-1 dimensional\\nboundary of the 2n dimensional space and obtaining the 2n-1 dimens ional CS action.\\nAgain, we need to check the consistency of the dimensional reduct ion from d=2n+1 to\\nd=2n. We have ¯R2n,2n+1=¯Ra,2n=¯Ra,2n+1=T2n=T2n+1= 0,¯Rab\\nµ,2n=Ta\\nµ.2n= 0. Using\\nthis, it is easy to check that the ωa,2n\\nΛ,ωa,2n+1\\nΛ,e2n\\nΛ,e2n+1\\nΛ, andω2n,2n+1\\nµ,ea\\n2n+1,ωab\\n2n+1equations\\nof motion are satisﬁed. The only nontrivial equation of motion is, as f or the CS to BI\\n8\\nreduction, the equation of motion for the nonzero ﬁeld, ω2n,2n+1\\n2n+1, which gives\\nǫa1...a2n−1¯Ra1a2∧...∧¯Ra2n−3a2n−2∧Ta2n−1= 0 (3.6)\\nor that the reduced Lagrangian is zero on-shell. As the lower dimens ional action (in d=2n)\\nis topological, there are no equations of motion to help us solve the co nsistency condition.\\nSo the KK reduction is again inconsistent in general, but now it become s consistent if\\nwe just go to a ﬁrst order formulation (for Ta= 0). Still, it would also be nice to ﬁnd\\nwhether there exists a way to make the reduction consistent, eith er by making a nonlinear\\nﬁeld redeﬁnition, or by keeping more ﬁelds.\\nLet us consider what would be a possible condition for ﬁnding a consist ent reduction.\\nWe will search for a reduction directly from 2n+1 to 2n-1 dimensions. An automatically\\nconsistent reduction would be found if one reduces the equations o f motion directly. The CS\\nequations of motion in d=2n+1 are\\nǫa1...a2n+1¯Ra1a2∧...∧¯Ra2n−1a2n= 0\\nǫa1...a2n+1¯Ra1a2∧...∧¯Ra2n−3a2n−2∧Ta2n−1= 0 (3.7)\\nThen the d=2n+1 CS equations of motion reduce to the d=2n-1 CS eq uations of motion if\\n¯Rd−1,d\\nd−1,d=c;¯Rab\\nµ,d−1=¯Rab\\nµ,d=¯Rab\\nd,d−1= 0;¯Rd,d−1\\nµν=¯Rd,d−1\\nµd=¯Rd,d−1\\nµd−1= 0\\nTa\\nµ,d−1=Ta\\nµ,d=Ta\\nd,d−1= 0;¯Ra,d−1=¯Ra,d=Td−1=Td= 0 (3.8)\\nas well as ¯Rab\\nµν=¯Rab\\nµν,red,Ta\\nµν=Ta\\nµν,red. However, satisfying these conditions, which are\\nwritten in gauge invariant way, in terms of the curvatures (ﬁeld str engths) of the AdS group\\nSO(d-1,2), by an explicit choice of gauge ﬁelds eA\\nΛandωAB\\nΛis quite diﬃcult, as we will see in\\nthe next section. We will ﬁnd the same conditions for the reduction f rom d=2n+2 to d=2n\\nBI gravity.\\n4 D=2n+2 BI to D=2n BI?\\nWehaveestablishedthatCSgravityreducestoBIgravity, andCSg ravityind=2n+1reduces\\nto CS in d=2n-1, albeit the issue of consistency of the reduction is no t settled, and that we\\ncannot reduce in a simple way BI to CS gravity. But we want to analyze in more detail the\\nBI to CS reduction, as well as the possibility of reduction of BI in d=2n +2 to BI in d=2n.\\nIn order to ﬁnd a consistent reduction of the BI theory in d=2n+2 t o the CS theory\\nin d=2n+1, we need to dimensionally reduce the corresponding equat ions of motion. We\\nsee that an embedding of the CS equations of motion (3.7) into the BI equations of motion\\n(2.12) (for n→n+1) is obtained if we can satisfy the following conditions on the SO(d-1 ,2)\\ngroup curvatures (ﬁeld strengths)\\n¯Ra,2n+2=Ra,2n+2+λea∧e2n+2= 0;T2n+2= 0;¯Rab\\nµ,2n+2=¯Ta\\nµ,2n+2= 0 (4.1)\\ntogether with the condition that e2n+2is nonzero and depends only on x2n+2and the fact\\nthatRab\\nµν=Rab\\nµν,redandTa\\nµν=Ta\\nµν,red.\\n9\\nWe try to satisfy them by using (the gauge condition) ea\\n2n+2= 0 and putting the gauge\\nﬁelde2n+2\\nµto zero also (that solves Ta\\nµν=Ta\\nµν,red), thus having only e2n+2\\n2n+2,ωa,2n+2\\nµ,ωab\\n2n+2,\\nωa,2n+2\\n2n+2nonzero.\\nThen from Rab\\nµν=Rab\\nµν,redwe getωa,2n+2\\n[µω2n+2,b\\nν]= 0 which is solved by ωa,2n+2\\nµ= 0, that\\nalso solves ¯Ra,2n+2\\nµν= 0 and T2n+2\\nµν= 0. However, then T2n+2\\nµ,2n+2= 0 gives ω2n+2,a\\n2n+2ea\\nµ= 0, so\\nω2n+2,a\\n2n+2= 0, which contradicts the condition that ¯Ra,2n+2\\nµ,2n+2= 0, since Ra,2n+2\\nµ,2n+2= 0, but e2n+2\\n2n+2ea\\nµ\\nis nonzero.\\nSo it seems there is no solution of this type. One could try to relax the condition that\\nRab\\nµν=Rab\\nµν,redand try to ﬁnd another way to embed the CS equations in the BI equa tions,\\nbut I have not been able to ﬁnd one, and it seems unlikely to be possible . The simplest\\npossibility is that we allow for a redeﬁnition of λ, by having Rab\\nµν=Rab\\nµν,red+kea\\n[µeb\\nν], which\\nwhen substituted in ¯Rab\\nµνgives a rescaling λ→λ+k, but this does not work either.\\nHowever, one can instead keep also ea\\n2n+2ande2n+2\\nµ(even though this was not needed\\nin usual KK reduction), but then the equations become too complica ted, and I did not ﬁnd\\na solution. It is also possible that global issues will allow nontrivial gaug e ﬁeldseA\\nΛ,ωAB\\nΛ,\\ndeﬁned on patches.\\nLet us turn to the possibility of ﬁnding a consistent reduction of the BI equations of\\nmotion in d=2n+2 to the ones in d=2n (2.12). Similarly, the conditions on the SO(d-1,2)\\ngroup curvatures are now\\n¯R2n+1,2n+2\\n2n+1,2n+2=c;¯Rab\\nµ,2n+1=¯Rab\\nµ,2n+2=¯Rab\\n2n+1,2n+2= 0;\\n¯R2n+1,2n+2\\nµν =¯R2n+1,2n+2\\nµ,2n+2=¯R2n+1,2n+2\\nµ,2n+1= 0\\nTa\\nµ,2n+1=Ta\\nµ,2n+2=Ta\\n2n+1,2n+2= 0;¯Ra,2n+1=¯Ra,2n+2=T2n+1=T2n+2= 0 (4.2)\\nwhich isthesameastheconditionforgoingfromd=2n+1CStod=2n-1 CS(3.8), taking into\\naccount the change in dimension. We will also add Ta\\nµν=Ta\\nµν,red, but we relax the condition\\nthatRab\\nµν=Rab\\nµν,redas above, by allowing for a rescaling of λviaRab\\nµν=Rab\\nµν,red+kea\\n[µeb\\nν].\\nWe look for solutions with nonzero e2n+1\\n2n+1,e2n+2\\n2n+2,e2n+1\\n2n+2,e2n+2\\n2n+1andω2n+1,2n+2\\n2n+1,ω2n+1,2n+2\\n2n+2,\\nωa,2n+1\\nµ,ωa,2n+2\\nµ, and all of them being only functions of xµ(dimensionally reduced co-\\nordinates) only. The last two ( ωa,2n+1\\nµ,ωa,2n+2\\nµ) need to be nonzero in order to ﬁnd a\\nnonzeroRa,2n+1\\nµ,2n+1,Ra,2n+2\\nµ,2n+2as needed. Then the condition that Rab\\nµν=Rab\\nµν,red+kea\\n[µeb\\nν]gives\\nωa,2n+1\\nµ=βea\\nµ,ωa,2n+2\\nµ=γea\\nµ, which in turn implies that Ra,2n+1\\nµν=βTa\\nµν,Ra,2n+2\\nµν=γTa\\nµνthus\\nare zero on-shell (for Ta= 0), as needed. Then the conditions (4.2) become (assuming that\\nei\\nm, i,m= 2n+1,2n+2 are constants)\\nω2n+2,2n+1\\n2n+1=−λ\\nγe2n+1\\n2n+1;ω2n+1,2n+2\\n2n+2=−λ\\nβe2n+2\\n2n+2;\\ne2n+1\\n2n+2=−γ\\nβe2n+2\\n2n+2;e2n+2\\n2n+1=−β\\nγe2n+1\\n2n+1 (4.3)\\nwhich solves everything, except one condition: now e2n+1\\n[2n+1e2n+2\\n2n+2]= 0, thus we obtain that\\n¯R2n+1,2n+2\\n2n+1,2n+2= 0 instead of a nonzero constant.\\n10\\nThus the natural simplest guess doesn’t work. However, now ther e are many more gener-\\nalizations to be tried: we can make the above ﬁelds depend also on x2n+1,x2n+2, and we can\\nreintroduce more ﬁelds: ei\\nµ,ea\\nm,ωa,i\\nm,ω2n+1,2n+2\\nµ, withi,m= 2n+ 1,2n+2. Unfortunately,\\nthen the equations required become prohibitively diﬃcult to solve.\\nA natural question to ask is whether we can also use a dimensional re duction based on\\na version of descent equations for the BI gravity, like we did for CS g ravity. The two would\\nnot be the same a priori, since as mentioned the descent equations n eed to be supplanted by\\na prescription about how to dimensionally reduce the gauge group als o, and moreover the\\nd=2n Lagrangian in the CS case is not the BI Lagrangian.\\nThe descent equations would be formally of the type I2n+2=dI2n+1,δI2n+1/δA=I2n,\\nand as we saw in the last section, the gauge ﬁeld that is put to one (co rresponding to δA)\\nneeds to be ω2n+1,2n+2\\n2n+1(it was actually ω2n,2n+1\\n2n+1in the last section because the gauge group\\nwas diﬀerent in d=2n). It will actually turn out that the ﬁrst step is t he hardest (writing\\nI2n+2as an exact form), so we will instead start with the second step. Th e BI Lagrangian\\nin d=2n is schematically of the type (ignoring indices)\\nL2n=n/summationdisplay\\np=0n!\\np!(n−p)!ǫR∧p∧(e∧e)∧(n−p)(4.4)\\nso by integrating with an δωit is easy to check (since/integraltext\\nδωR(ω)∧p∼S2p+1,CS(ω) and one\\ncan explicitly check a few examples) that the d=2n+1 Lagrangian tha t gives the d=2n one\\nbyω2n+1,2n+2\\n2n+1= 1 is\\nL2n+1=n/summationdisplay\\np=0n!\\n(p+1)p!(n−p)!ǫ”I2p+1,CS(ω)”∧(e∧e)∧(n−p)\\n=n/summationdisplay\\np=0n!\\n(p+1)!(n−p)!ǫa1...a2n+2Ia1...a2p+2\\n2p+1,CS(ω)∧ea2p+3∧...∧ea2n+2(4.5)\\nwhere in the ﬁrst line we wrote the action schematically and in the seco nd lineIa1...a2p+2\\n2p+1,CS(ω)\\nis the integrand that contracted with ǫa1...a2p+2(for gauge group SO(2p+2)) would give the\\ncorresponding CS form. Of course, on the ﬁrst line, we don’t have a CS form, since although\\nit is contracted with an epsilon, the sum runs over 2n+2 indices instea d of 2p+2. If we would\\nactually have a CS form, then we would have schematically\\ndL2n+1=n/summationdisplay\\np=0n!\\n(p+1)!(n−p)!ǫR∧(p+1)(ω)∧(e∧e)∧(n−p)+terms with de(4.6)\\nto be compared with the BI form minus the cosmological constant te rm\\nL2n+2−e∧(2n+2)= (n+1)n/summationdisplay\\np=0n!\\n(p+1)!(n−p)!R∧(p+1)(ω)∧(e∧e)∧(n−p)(4.7)\\nthus we would obtain all terms in L2n+2except the cosmological constant term, and we\\nwould get extra determs. As mentioned however, we don’t have the actual CS form, a nd\\n11\\nconsequently we also don’t have the I2p+2(ω) form in dL2n+1, for the same reason, that in\\nthe epsilon group contraction, the sum runs over 2n+2 instead of 2 p+2 indices. As a result\\nfor instance, the terms of type ǫa1...a2n+2(ω∧ω)a1a2∧...∧(ω∧ω)a2p+1a2p+2∧ea2p+3∧...∧ea2n+2\\nare not zero, and they cannot be obtained from a derivative of som ething. In a I2p+2(ω)\\nform, the terms ǫa1...a2p+2(ω∧ω)a1a2∧...∧(ω∧ω)a2p+1a2p+2are actually zero by symmetry,\\nas can be easily seen using a general formalism. In I2n=FA1∧...∧FAntA1...An, with\\ntA1...An=tr(TA1...TAn) in the corresponding representation, the term with no dA’s can be\\nrewritten as AB1∧AC1∧...∧ABn∧ACntr(TB1TC1...TBnTCn), and while the trace is cyclically\\nsymmetric, the gauge ﬁelds multiplying it are antisymmetric.\\nA last hope to get the right result would be to rewrite the terms with deby using the\\ntorsion constraint, T=de+ω∧e= 0 (thus on-shell), which would generate a lot of terms\\nwith extra ω’s, including ones with no derivatives at all. But ﬁrst of all there will be t oo\\nmany terms then, and even in the lowest dimensional relevant case ( when the type of terms\\nmatches), for d=4 reduced to d=2, we don’t get the correct resu lt. Then we have\\nL3=ǫabcdωab∧(dωcd+2\\n3ωce∧ωed+2ec∧ed)\\ndL3=ǫabcd(dωab∧dωcd+2ωab∧(ωce∧ωed)\\n+2dωab∧ec∧ed+4ωae∧ωeb∧ec∧ed) (4.8)\\nwhereasL4has a 2 instead of a 4 multiplying the last term and of course the extra ǫabcdea∧\\neb∧ec∧edterm. To get the second line we have used Ta= 0 to replace deawith−ωab∧eb,\\nand used antisymmetry identities to recouple the indices.\\nLet us mention that although (4.6) doesn’t match (4.7), a lot of it doe s: the term with\\np=n, with no vielbein and only spin connections obviously works, since it is just due to a\\nusual type of descent equation. Also the terms with only dω’s and no ω’s orde’s work (as\\nshouldbeobvious fromthe I2p+1,CS(ω)analogyin(4.5)). Itisalsoclear thatthecosmological\\nconstant term ǫa1...a2n+2ea1∧...∧ea2n+2cannot be obtained, since it has no derivatives or ω’s.\\nIntheusual descent equations, theterm withonlyA’s andnodA’s isz ero by symmetry aswe\\nsaw, but now we cannot interpret ǫa1...a2n+2astr(TB1TC1...TBn+1TCn+1), since the epsilon term\\nis cyclically antisymmetric, whereas the trace is cyclically symmetric (w hich is the origin of\\nthe vanishing of the this term in the usual descent equations).\\nIn conclusion, we see that the descent equation formalism for redu cing BI to BI doesn’t\\nwork, and the consistent reduction of the equations of motion has no simple solution, al-\\nthough a complicated one might exist.\\n5 Discussion and conclusions\\nIn this paper I have analyzed the possible dimensional reductions be tween the Chern-Simons\\n(in d=2n+1) and Born-Infeld (in d=2n) gravity theories. These are gauge theories of the\\nAdS groups SO(d-1,2), with gauge ﬁelds the vielbein and spin connect ion. The fact that\\nthey are deﬁned as gauge theories means that in principle one can th ink of them as being\\ndeﬁned in auxiliary spaces, and the vielbein and spin connection treat ed as regular gauge\\n12\\nﬁelds on the space. The important fact is that the 4d Born-Infeld t heory is just the Einstein\\ntheory in ﬁrst order formulation for the vielbein and spin connection , with a cosmological\\nconstant term and an extra topological term (the 4d Euler density ). Thus classically, this\\ntheory is the same as Einstein theory. The addition of the particular topological term is\\nneeded for a variety of reasons, see for instance [17].\\nI have found that the 4d BI theory can be obtained by a generalized dimensional re-\\nduction of the 5d CS theory (a reduction modelled after the usual K K reduction in ﬁrst\\norder formalism), which has e5\\n5=c(constant) and the rest of the extra ﬁelds to zero. The\\nreduction is only consistent if the local version of a global condition, eq. (2.14), is satisﬁed.\\nA result by Chamseddine [20] showing that the ﬂuctuations around a similar background of\\n5d CS theory match ﬂuctuations around 4d Einstein theory, sugge st that there should be a\\nway to make the reduction consistent (either by a nonlinear redeﬁn ition of ﬁelds as in [18, 19]\\nor by the addition of more ﬁelds as for the original Kaluza Klein reduct ion). The reduction\\ngeneralizes to CS theory in d=2n+1 reduced to BI theory in d=2n, bu t the consistency\\nconditions are more complicated.\\nI have shown that the reverse reduction, of d=2n+2 BI theory, u sing the same ansatz,\\ndoes not result in the d=2n+1 CS theory, but rather in a new action ( 3.4). Instead, I have\\nshown that one can use a new type of dimensional reduction, which is a generalization of\\nthe descent equations formalism, ” δI2n+1/δA=I2n”,I2n=dI2n−1. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst step\\nis done by putting ω2n,2n+1\\n2n+1= 1 and the rest of the extra ﬁelds to zero, which does not\\nhave an analog in usual dimensional reduction. The second step is ju st reducing a the d=2n\\ntopological theory on the boundary to the d=2n+1 CS theory. This is a generalization of\\nthe descent equations formalism, since one needs to deﬁne a ”dimen sional reduction of the\\ngauge group” as well (in the usual descent equations, the gauge g roup stays the same). The\\ndimensional reduction is found to be consistent if the reduced Lagr angian is zero on-shell,\\nor if we go to a second order formulation by Ta= 0. I also gave an ansatz for the SO(d-1,2)\\nﬁeld strengths (curvatures) that would automatically give a consis tent reduction of d=2n+1\\nto d=2n-1 CS gravity, if one could ﬁnd a set of gauge ﬁelds that satis fy these conditions.\\nFor the reduction from d=2n+2 BI to d=2n+1 CS gravity, or directly from d=2n+2 BI\\nto d=2n BI gravity, I have given also ansatze for the ﬁeld strength s, that if satisﬁed by a\\nset of gauge ﬁelds would automatically give a consistent reduction. U nfortunately, I was not\\nable to ﬁnd solutions to them: the natural simple ansatze that I hav e tried do not work.\\nI have also tried a generalization of the descent equation formalism f or the reduction from\\nd=2n+2 BI to d=2n BI gravity (which is not a priori the same as the on e for d=2n+1 CS to\\nd=2n-1 CS, as there the d=2naction is not BI, and also one needs to deﬁne the ”dimensional\\nreduction of the gauge group”). I have found an actionin d=2n+1, (4.5) that can be reduced\\nto the BI action in d=2n via ω2n+1,2n+2\\n2n+1=c, however the derivative of that integrand does\\nnot give the d=2n+2 BI integrand, but rather comes close.\\nLet us comment now on the possible implications of this work. As mentio ned, the BI\\nand CS actions are gauge theories of the AdS groups SO(d-1,2), wit h generators PaandJab.\\nWhen dimensionally reducing d=2n+1 CS theory to d=2n-1 CS theory, the intermediate\\nd=2n theory we considered is a topological theory. Thus the 4d BI t heory, which is the\\nEinstein theory in the presence of a cosmological constant, and wit h a topological term (the\\n13\\n4d Euler density) added, is embedded in higher dimensional topologica l theories, via the\\nCS theories. This is similar to the 3d case analyzed by Witten [4], where E instein gravity\\nactually is of CS type (and can thus be embedded in a 4d topological th eory), and this\\nhelped in deﬁning a good and renormalizable quantum gravity theory. The hope is that one\\ncan use the same techniques now to help deﬁne 4d Einstein quantum g ravity, although of\\ncourse how that can be done remains an open question.\\nNote that by successive dimensional reductions the 4d BI gravity t heory can be be em-\\nbedded in 11d CS gravity theory with SO(10,2) gauge group. In [9, 14 ] it was argued that M\\ntheory should have an invariance group OSp(1|32)×OSp(1|32) (the necessity of OSp(1|32)\\nas a possible invariance group for 11d supergravity was already arg ued for in the original\\npaper [21]), and a Chern-Simons supergravity for this group was co nstructed, that included\\nthe SO(10,2) Chern-Simons gravity as the purely gravitational par t (see also [10, 11, 12]).\\nAnd because experimentally the cosmological constant is small, and λmeasures the size of\\nterms with many R’s with respect to terms with fewer R’s, physically we are in the λ→0\\nlimit, or high energy limit, in which it was argued in [9] that usual 11d supe rgravity should\\nbe obtained. In particular, in this limit, the OSp(1|32)×OSp(1|32) group contracts to the\\ngroup of d’Auria and Fre [22], describing usual 11d supergravity (alm ost) as a gauge theory.\\nFinally, it should be noted that the d=2n topological actions with gaug e group SO(2n-\\n2,2) that reduce on the boundary to d=2n-1 CS have a natural inte rpretation as a pure\\nspin connection theory in a space with signature (2n-2,2). Indeed, with Ωab=ωab,Ωa,2n=\\nea,a= 1,2n−1, the curvatures RAB(Ω) =dΩAB+ΩAC∧ΩCBsplit into Rab(Ω) =¯Rab(ω)\\nandRa,2n(Ω) =Ta, and now Ω can be actually interpreted as a spin connection on the ba se\\nspace. In the paper we have used ωabandea(where a=1,2n-1) for this d=2n topological\\naction as just SO(2n-2,2) gauge ﬁelds on the base space with signat ure (2n-1,1), but then\\nthey cannot have the interpretation of spin connection and vielbein on the base space! In\\nparticular, the index aruns over 2n-1 values instead of 2n. Note that for the BI and CS\\ntheories, one can however interpret ωabandeaas spin connection and vielbein, respectively\\n(the indices run over the correct number of values).\\nThe useof(2n-2,2)signature, andtheinterpretationofthetheo ryaspurespin connection\\ntheory might appear unusual for general n. But for n=6, i.e. (10,2 ) dimensions, there is a\\nreason for taking it under consideration. The maximal supergravit y in 4d is N= 8, and\\nthe 8 gravitini become a single one in both (10,1) and (10,2) dimensions , i.e. the theory\\nwith minimal supersymmetry in both (10,1) and (10,2) dimensions would have the maximal\\nN= 8 in 4d. Therefore many people have searched for a supergravity theory in (10,2)\\ndimensions (see for instance [23]), but of course the presence of t wo times with its known\\nacausality issues makes that search problematic for an usual theo ry of gravity. But now\\nthe theory in (10,2) dimensions would have only a spin connection and n o vielbein, and\\nmoreover it would be topological! So it certainly makes sense, and per haps one can ﬁnd also\\na supersymmetric version (perhaps as in [9]) that would be related to usual 11d supergravity\\norN= 8 4d supergravity.\\nAcknowledgements This research has been done with support from MEXT’s program\\n”Promotion of Environmental Improvement for Independence of Young Researchers” under\\nthe Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technolo gy.\\n14\\nReferences\\n[1] Z.Bern, L.J.
