      "Quantum physics is a branch of classical physics, which plays an important role in macroscopic physics, chemistry and biology. However, there are phenomena occuring in the quantum world which do not have a counter part in the classical world. Examples are entanglement, according to Schr¨ odinger themost peculiar property occuring inquantum mech anics, orthe condensationofvery coldatomspredictedbyEinsteinandBose ( Bo se-Einstein condensate ). Another example is nonlinear dynamics and chaos, da ting back to the work of Poincar´ e and its modern descendents - quantum chaos Chaos is a well-known phenomenon in classical physics. Its origin in terms of non linear dynamics has been investigated thoroughly in theoretical physics a nd math- ematics. If one considers nature at the level of atoms, where the laws of quantum mechanics ( Q.M. ) hold, chaotic phenomena are by far less we ll un- derstood than in classical ( macroscopic ) physics. We suggest that the quantum action is an appropriate tool to in vestigate phenomena on the borderline between classical and quantum physic s and to analyze quantum tunneling, quantum instantons and quantum chao s. In thefollowing we discuss theconcept of the Quantum mechanics is a general theory of the dynamics of the system ( i. e., the system ). In classical mechanics, equations of motions ar e ﬁxed by specifying the dynamics ( usually in terms of a diﬀerential equation ) and by specifying initial conditions. Usually one speciﬁes position and veloc ity at some initial time. A consequence of this type of boundary conditions is that certain trajectories are forbidden. For example those where the energy is too small to overcome a potential barrier. Moreover, this initial condit ion has no direct analogon in Q.M. However, there is a simple way out : Consider cla ssical mechanics with 2-point boundary conditions. Quantum action is the action of a system in the limit of large imaginary time. In this limit the time evolution of a quantum system is determined by the behavior of exp [ −HT//planckover2pi1 ] whenTgoes to∞. In particular, one has e−HT//Planckover 2pi1−→T→∞|ψgr/angbracketrighte−EgrT//planckerover2p1/ANGbracketleftψg|, whereEgrandψgrarethe groundstate energy andwave function, respectively. The quantum action has a number of remarkable prop erties: ( i ) TheWKBapproximationforthegroundstate Quantum potentials are a much better description of the behavior of the quantum system than t he classical potential, which does not share those properties. For example, the ground state energy and wave function ψgr ( x ) are the same as in real time, and the minimum of th e quantum potential coincides with the position of the maximum of the ground st ate wave function. This is shown in Fig. 1. The quantum potential gives a better picture of the dynamics of the system than the classical potential. In this paper, we show that the transition amplit ude between the kinitic term and the potential <s><s>Quantum instantons. Weconsiderquantummechanics in1-D as a generalization of the classical action. As an example let us consider the radial motion of the hydrogen atom in a se ctor of ﬁxed angular momentum l > 0. The potential has a centrifugal plus a Coulomb term. The radial potential is given by Vl ( r ) =/planckover2pi12l ( l+1 ) 2mr2−e2 r. In the Feynman-Kac limit the transition amplitude is projected onto the state of lowest energy c ompatible with quantum number l. The exact energy of the excited states <s>Quantum chaos. The hydrogen atom in the presence of strong magnetic ﬁelds has been explored experimentally and theoretically. It dis- plays quantum chaos via disorder in the spectrum. In the regime of h igh lying excited states, where the system becomes semi-classical, Gutzwille r ’ s trace for- mula has been applied successfully by Wintgen [ 20 ] to extract periodic orbit information. Here we suggest to explore quantum chaos by solving the Euler-Lagrange equations of m otion of the Euclidean classical action, with the initial conditions x ( t=−∞ ) Chaos is one of the most important phenomena in physics. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ’ some ’ pha se space generated by the quantum action via the quantum Hamiltonian. As a prototype system, we con sider a 2-dim non-integrable Hamiltonian, with a classically chaotic counter part. The quantum Poincar´ e section correspo nds to transition time T= 4.5. The energy has been chosen to be E= 10. One can observe some diﬀerences between the classical and the quant um system. Further numerical studies have shown the following behavior : For small v22, Poincarc´ e sections of classical and quantum physics are quite sim Quantum superposition is the phenomenon of quantum superposition in macroscopic states. In condensed matter physics, superconducting quantum interfe rence devices ( SQUID ) havebeenusedbyFriedmanetal todemonstrateexperim entallythe phenomenon of superposition. The SQUID potential has a double-well stru cture. The quantum action allows to construct a quantum potential and analyz e such quantum potential in terms of the quantum potential.
