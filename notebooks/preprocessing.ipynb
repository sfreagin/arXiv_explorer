      "['Spectra and Structure of Accretion Disks with Non-zero Inner ', 'Torque ', '', '', '', '', 'We present numerical spectral and vertical structure calculations appropri- ', 'ate for near-Eddington luminosity, radiation pressure dominated accretion disks ', 'around stellar mass black holes. We cover a wide range of black hole spins, and ', 'incorporate dissipation proﬁles based on ﬁrst-principles three-dimensional MHD ', 'disk interior simulations. We also include non-zero stresses at the ISCO, which ', 'results in the disk eﬀective temperature to increase rapidly towards the black ', 'hole, and give rise to rather extreme conditions with high temperatures and low ', 'surface densities. We found that local annuli spectra become increasingly charac- ', 'teristic of saturated Comptonisation with decreasing distance to the black hole. ', 'While the spectra becomes harder with increasing black hole spin, they do not ', 'give rise to a broad power law tail even at maximum spin. We discuss the impli- ', 'cations of our results in the context of the steep power law (SPL) state and the ', 'associated high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPO) observed in some ', 'X-ray binary systems. ', 'Subject headings: accretion, accretion disks — black hole physics — X-rays: ', 'binaries — spectra ', '', '', 'Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BHB) show several states of outburst distinguished ', 'by luminosity, spectral shape and variability (see for example, McClintock & Remillard ', '(2006) and Done, Gierlinski, & Kubota (2007)). In particular, at their highest luminosities ', 'the spectra contains a steep power law component with photon index Γ > 2.4 (McClintock & Remillard ', '2006). These energetically signiﬁcant power law tails begin at the spectral peak (≈ 10 keV) ', 'and could extend into the MeV regime (Ling & Wheaton 2005; Grove et al. 1998). More- ', 'over, this steep power law (SPL) spectral state is accompanied by high-frequency (ν > 50 Hz) ', '', 'quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPO) in the light curves when integrated over approximately ', '10 to 30 keV in photon energies. ', 'Understanding the ﬁrst-principles physics of radiating accretion ﬂows that presumably ', 'underly these observational properties remain an important outstanding problem in astro- ', 'physics. The standard thin accretion disk model (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Novikov & Thorne ', '1973; Riﬀert & Herold 1995) assumed that the stress and luminosity at the innermost stable ', 'circular orbit (ISCO) drops to zero, and that at this point the material essentially simply dis- ', 'appears into the black hole. This assumption received signiﬁcant recent theoretical scrutiny ', 'upon the realization that magnetohydrodynamic turbulence (Balbus and Hawley 1991, 1998) ', 'is probably the source of stress that drives accretion. In particular, Agol and Krolik (2000) ', 'demonstrated that having non-zero magnetic stresses at the ISCO can cause the eﬀective ', 'temperature to rise sharply towards the black hole instead of fall to zero as predicted by ', 'the standard model. Among the potentially observable consequences postulated by these ', 'authors, the inner disk consequently becomes eﬀectively thin, and extends the spectrum to ', 'higher frequencies. ', 'More recently, Dexter & Blaes (2014) (from here on referred to as DB14) proposed that ', 'the Agol and Krolik (2000) model provides feasible mechanism for explaining both the steep ', 'power law (SPL) state seen at near Eddington luminosities and the associated high frequency ', 'quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPO). These authors argued that the rapidly rising eﬀective ', 'temperature with decreasing distance to the black hole would give rise to the SPL spectra, ', 'while also providing a natural ﬁlter for the HFQPOs that do not require the entire disk to ', 'oscillate coherently. ', 'In this work, we undertake a detailed numerical study of the structure and spectra of ', 'near-Eddington accretion disks with non-zero magnetic stresses the ISCO, and particularly ', 'focus on the eﬀects of black hole spin. Unlike previous eﬀorts that relied on one-zone models, ', 'we self-consistently couple vertical structure to radiative transfer at each disk annuli, and ', 'generate spectra that fully incorporates eﬀects Comptonisation and metal opacities. Our ', 'inputs are time and horizontally averaged vertical dissipation proﬁles from ﬁrst-principles ', 'stratiﬁed shearing-box simulations of accretion ﬂows (Hirose, Krolik & Blaes 2009). These ', 'calculations evolve the time-dependent three-dimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamic ', 'equations and accounts for the tidal vertical gravity from the black hole. In simulations over ', 'a wide range of box-integrated radiation to gas pressure ratios, the resulting vertical spatial ', 'dissipation proﬁles generally peak at around a pressure scale-height away from the disk ', 'mid-plane, and should capture the eﬀects of MRI turbulence. Moreover, these simulations ', 'collectively indicate that the α-prescription (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) relationship between ', 'pressure and stress approximately hold (Hirose, Blaes & Krolik 2009). This means we are ', '', 'justiﬁed, at least in light of recent simulations, to use the α-model with modiﬁcations to ', 'account for non-zero inner torque to generate radial proﬁles of total surface density Σ0 and ', 'eﬀective temperature Teﬀ that are also necessary for our vertical structure and radiative ', 'transfer computations. ', 'This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we outline our numerical methods, paying ', 'particular attention to how we incorporated non-zero inner torque. Section 3 showcases our ', 'numerical results, including full-disk spectra for all black hole spin values we covered. We ', 'turn to the possibility of HFQPOs in section 4, and conclude in section 5 with a discussion ', 'of on-going and future work. ', '', 'We compute one-dimensional, time-independent and non-LTE disk annuli vertical struc- ', 'ture and spectral models using the stellar atmosphere code TLUSTY (Hubeny & Lanz 1995) ', 'that has been adapted for accretion disk applications (Hubeny & Hubeny 1998; Hubeny et al. ', '2000). The program self-consistently solves the disk vertical structure equations along with ', 'angle-dependent and multi-frequency radiative transfer, and does not assume that the spec- ', 'trum is modiﬁed from a blackbody via spectral hardening factors. We treat electron (both ', 'Thomson and Compton) scattering with an angle-averaged Kompaneets source function ', '(Hubeny et al. 2001), and allow for deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium by ', 'explicitly computing ion populations for hydrogen, helium and metals. ', 'TLUSTY self-consistently calculates the vertical structure of and local emergent spec- ', 'trum from an accretion disk annuli. To specify an annuli, TLUSTY requires as input the ', 'mid-plane surface density Σ0 (Figure 1), eﬀective temperature Teﬀ (Figure 2), and orbital ', 'frequency squared Ω2, all of which are functions of distance from the black hole. ', 'Inter- ', 'ested readers can consult previous TLUSTY-based work such as Davis et al. (2005) and ', 'Tao & Blaes (2013) for more details on using and modifying the code, as well as further ', 'discussions of numerical considerations. Next, we focus on how we generated these input ', 'parameters for a given blackhole mass and spin while incorporating both non-zero torque at ', 'disk inner boundary and simulation based dissipation physics. ', 'We made several assumptions and approximations may impact the disk spectra and ', 'vertical structure that we will compute. First, we characterized the ionized plasma with a ', 'single gas temperature Tg because the mean free path of electron-ion collisions is much less ', 'than disk scale height, and therefore the electrons and protons are thermally locked. Further, ', 'we only consider vertical radiative diﬀusion for energy transport, so that we can relate the ', '', '', '', 'dF ', 'dz ', '', '', 'where z is the height measured vertically upward (with z = 0 at mid-plane). By analyzing ', 'several shearing box simulations, Blaes et al. (2011) found that radiative diﬀusion is probably ', 'not the only important vertical energy transport mechanism. Speciﬁcally, radiation pressure ', 'work and magnetic buoyancy driven radiation advection can be as important as diﬀusive ', 'ﬂux near the mid-planes of radiation pressure dominated disks. However, these simulations ', 'also showed that radiative diﬀusion still dominates at higher altitudes, so that in the end it ', 'is still the primary means to carry dissipated energy into the photospheric region where the ', 'spectrum forms. We therefore suspect that the emergent spectra will not change drastically ', 'even if we included radiative advection. On the other hand, more recent global simulations ', 'found radiative advection to be important even in the outﬂow regions of super-Eddington ', 'accretion ﬂows (Jiang, Stone & Davis 2014), but how these results would impact the spectra ', 'is not yet clear. Finally, we ignore potentially important the eﬀects of irradiation and outﬂow. ', 'We also do not include magnetic ﬁelds in this study. While simulations such as those de- ', 'scribed in Hirose, Krolik & Blaes (2009) found that magnetic pressure can be just as impor- ', 'tant, and even dominate over, radiation pressure in disk outer layers. However, Davis et al. ', '(2009) showed that the expected hardening of the spectra due to signiﬁcant magnetic sup- ', 'port against gravity is largely compensated by the softening eﬀects of complex density in- ', 'homogeneities around the photospheric regions. Moreover, radiative transfer calculations ', 'incorporating simulation-based vertical magnetic acceleration (Tao & Blaes 2013) showed ', 'that dissipation proﬁles is what primarily drove signiﬁcant changes in spectral shapes. ', 'To generate input for TLUSTY and study the eﬀects of non-zero inner torque, we ', 'use the results of Agol and Krolik (2000) as implemented by DB14 to numerically compute ', 'the vertically integrated surface density Σ0 (Figure 1), eﬀective temperature Tef f (Figure ', '2) and orbital frequency Ø as a function of distance from the black hole by solving one- ', 'zone relativistic radial structure equations. Compared to the standard thin disk models ', '(Novikov & Thorne 1973), Agol and Krolik (2000) adds a single parameter ∆ǫ that char- ', 'acterizes the additional radiative eﬃciency (relative to one computed in terms of only the ', 'binding energy) due to including a non-zero torque at the disk’s inner edge. Our modeled ', 'disks accrete onto a 7 solar mass black hole with α = 0.02 (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). We ', 'chose the normalized accretion rates ', '', '˙ ', 'ǫ ˙M c2 ', 'LEdd ', '', '(ǫ0 + ∆ǫ) ˙M c2 ', 'LEdd ', '', 'such that the disk luminosity is approximately Eddington, where ǫ0 is the accretion eﬃciency ', 'without enhancement due to the inner torque. Our models cover several black hole spins ', '', 'ranging from a/M = 0.4 to a/M = 0.99. For all spin values, we set ∆ǫ to 0.1. We divide ', 'each disk into many (on the order of 50, and vary slightly between models) annuli starting ', 'at the ISCO. Finally, we use a relativistic transfer code (Agol 1997) to obtain the full disk ', 'spectra as seen by distant observers.

', 'Note that even the innermost annuli for disks around higher spin (0.8 and 0.99) black ', 'holes do not show powerful high-energy power-law spectral tails characteristic of unsat- ', 'urated Compton up-scattering. This is because while the gas temperature in the pho- ', 'tospheric regions can reach beyond 108 K, none of our annuli models show a rapid and ', 'large increase between the temperature minima and the scattering photosphere, making it ', 'impossible to signiﬁcantly up-scatter photons within a small number of collisions before ', 'they lose thermal coupling with the gas.

If such variability ', 'are due to underlying ﬂuid oscillations determined by space-time properties, the associated ', 'frequencies would also cover only a narrow range, giving rise to sharp power spectra peaks ', 'characteristic of HFQPOs (DB14). Such a scenario would naturally explain why HFQPOs ', 'are observed in the hard X-ray bands (greater than about 2 keV). ', 'To extract potential QPO proﬁles from our models, we assume that each annulus oscil- ', 'lates at the vertical epicyclic frequency at that radius, since this mode has been observed ', 'to be prominent in both local (Hirose, Krolik & Blaes 2009; Blaes et al. 2011) and global ', '(Reynolds & Miller 2009) MHD simulations. To compute the relative power, we normalize ', 'the ﬂux in each energy band at a particular radius by the total disk ﬂux in that band, and ', 'then squaring to convert to power. Figure 12 shows representative QPO power spectra, ', 'which are prominent and have Q values between approximately 2 and 3. These quality fac- ', 'tors are broadly comparable to those found by DB14, except in the 13 − 30 keV band where ', 'our results are smaller by about a factor of 2. The existence of prominent QPO proﬁles in ', 'our models contradicts observations since the entire sample of HFQPO above 100 Hz were ', 'detected in the SPL state (McClintock & Remillard 2006), which do not appear in our spec- ', 'tra. It is plausible including additional physics that we are missing here can lead to disk ', 'models including inner torque that exhibit both SPL and HFQPOs. ', '', 'We performed detailed spectral and structure calculations for accretion disks with non- ', 'zero stresses near the inner orbit. We self-consistently coupled the radiative transfer and ', 'vertical structure equations at each annulus. We also incorporated physically motivated ', 'vertical energy dissipation proﬁles obtained by averaging results from three-dimensional local ', 'shearing box simulations (Hirose, Krolik & Blaes 2009) horizontally and in time. Finally, we ', 'computed disk integrated spectra as seen by distant observers via a fully relativistic transfer ', 'function (Agol 1997). ', 'Our results agree qualitatively with those based on one-zone models that essentially ', 'neglect vertical structure. However, the quantitative diﬀerences between our ﬁndings and ', '', 'previous work is suﬃciently large to result in signiﬁcantly altered disk integrated spectra. ', 'In general, the full disk spectra is non-thermal but do not display features resembling a ', 'powerful SPL tail. This is because for annuli close to the black hole (r/rg less than about ', '10), the gas temperature at the scattering photosphere, which tracks the energy at which the ', 'spectrum of a saturated Compton scattering dominated atmosphere peaks, does not rise as ', 'rapidly towards the black hole as predicted by one-zone models. In other words, the spectral ', 'peaks of the eﬀectively thin annuli are not suﬃciently ‘separated’ to form a power law tail. ', 'Models with higher a/M (0.8 and 0.99) further results in even higher annuli eﬀective ', 'temperatures near the black hole as well as stronger relativistic eﬀects. In particular, when ', 'viewed nearly edge-on the a/M = 0.99 disk displayed strong non-thermal tail that extended ', 'to our upper energy limit. We caution that this ﬁnding is not directly comparable the spectra ', 'generated by DB14, which exhibited powerful power-law tails regardless of viewing angle. ', 'While our calculations suggest that including torque at the inner disk edge do not result ', 'in SPL-like spectra, we did see evidence that such models may produce HFQPOs, albeit with ', 'lower qualify factors than those from the one-zone models of DB14. This is because photons ', 'beyond about 10 keV from most of our models still come primarily from a small range of ', 'annuli close to the black hole, so that the power spectra restricted to such high-energy hands ', 'contains only a narrow range of vertical epicyclic oscillation frequencies. ', 'We suspect that higher values of ∆ǫ would produce still harder spectra with more promi- ', 'nent high-energy tails at lower viewing angles, which may result in SPL-like spectra with ', 'broad and energetic power-law tails that began at lower energies. However, such atmospheres ', 'are even more eﬀectively thin, which coupled with lower surface density make obtaining con- ', 'verged spectral and vertical structure models challenging. These calculations are currently ', 'underway, and will appear in a follow up paper on the dependence of spectra on a wider ', 'parameter range. ', 'As mentioned earlier, in adopting the Agol and Krolik (2000) solution for radial disk ', 'proﬁle we have assumed a thin disk model, which is likely inappropriate for radiation pressure ', 'dominated disks radiating at near-Eddington luminosity. It would be interesting to incor- ', 'porate inner torque physics into slim disk models (Abramowicz et al. 1988; Sadowski et al. ', '2011), and use the resulting radial structure as starting point to compute the vertical struc- ', 'ture and ultimately emergent spectra. ', 'Another potential extension of this work would be incorporating a wider range of ', 'simulation-based dissipation physics, especially in light of recent advances towards under- ', 'standing energy transport and dissipation in accretion disks. In particular, global simulations ', 'of Schnittman, Krolik & Nobel (2013) and spectral calculations of Tao & Blaes (2013) both ', '', 'suggested that strong dissipation in disk outer layers could result in energetic power law spec- ', 'tra, which combined with the inner torque physics we explored may oﬀer a way to obtain ', 'both SPL spectra and HFQPOs within self-consistent disk structure and radiative transfer ', 'calculations. ', 'Finally, we note that radiation pressure dominated disks may be thermally unsta- ', 'ble (Lightman & Eardley 1974), as seen in radiation MHD shearing box simulations of ', 'Jiang, Stone & Davis (2013). However, there is almost no observational evidence of such ', 'instabilities in BHBs. On the other hand, global simulations such as Jiang, Stone & Davis ', '(2014) do not yet include the entire disk, and the ultimate non-linear saturation of the ', 'instability is still an open problem.
