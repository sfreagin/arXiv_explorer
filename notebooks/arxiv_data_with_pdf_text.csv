  Instantons",['H. Kr√∂ger'],2003-02-21T20:20:47Z,2003-02-21T20:20:47Z,"We discuss the recently proposed quantum action - its interpretation, its
motivation, its mathematical properties and its use in physics: quantum
mechanical tunneling, quantum instantons and quantum chaos.",http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302169v1,

Can classical physics agree with quantum physics on quantum phenomena?,['Michele Marrocco'],2015-04-13T15:04:26Z,2015-04-13T15:04:26Z,"Classical physics fails where quantum physics prevails. This common
understanding applies to quantum phenomena that are acknowledged to be beyond
the reach of classical physics. Here, we make an attempt at weakening this
solid belief that classical physics is unfit to explain the quantum world. The
trial run is the quantization of the free radiation field that will be
addressed by following a strategy that is free from operators or
quantum-mechanical concepts",http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03207v1,
The Physics of Quantum Information,['John Preskill'],2022-08-17T04:35:36Z,2022-08-17T04:35:36Z,"Rapid ongoing progress in quantum information science makes this an apt time
for a Solvay Conference focused on The Physics of Quantum Information. Here I
review four intertwined themes encompassed by this topic: Quantum computer
science, quantum hardware, quantum matter, and quantum gravity. Though the time
scale for broad practical impact of quantum computation is still uncertain, in
the near future we can expect noteworthy progress toward scalable
fault-tolerant quantum computing, and discoveries enabled by programmable
quantum simulators. In the longer term, controlling highly complex quantum
matter will open the door to profound scientific advances and powerful new
technologies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08064v1,

Universal Uncertainty Principle in Different Quantum Theories,"['C. Huang', 'Yong-Chang Huang']",2018-07-29T07:50:32Z,2018-07-29T07:50:32Z,"This paper deduces universal uncertainty principle in different quantum
theories after about one century of proposing uncertainty principle by
Heisenberg, i.e., new universal uncertainty principle of any orders of physical
quantities in quantum physics, overcomes the difficulty that current quantum
computer, quantum communication, quantum control, quantum mechanics and so on
theories cannot give exact values of general uncertainty of any orders of
physical quantities, further gives all relevant different expressions of the
universal uncertainty principle and their applications. In fact, our studies
are consistent with current theories and physical factual experiments, e.g.,
relevant to hydrogen atom physics experiments. Using the new universal
uncertainty principle, people can give all applications to atomic physics,
quantum mechanics, quantum communication, quantum calculations, quantum
computer and so on.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11019v1,
