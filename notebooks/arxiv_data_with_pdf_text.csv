Abstract. We discuss the recently proposed quantum action - its interp retation, its moti-
vation, its mathematical properties and its use in physics: quantum mechanical tunneling,
quantum instantons and quantum chaos.
1.Introduction. Modern physics returns to some of its origins dating back
to the ﬁrst part of the last century. Examples are entanglement, according to
Schr¨ odinger themost peculiar property occuring inquantum mech anics, orthe
condensationofvery coldatomspredictedbyEinsteinandBose(Bo se-Einstein
condensate). Another example is nonlinear dynamics and chaos, da ting back
to the work of Poincar´ e and others and its modern descendents - quantum
chaos. Entanglement plays a fundamental role in quantum optics, q uantum
computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teletransport ation [1, 2].

important role in macroscopic physics, chemistry and biology. Quant um chaos
may become quite important for example in semiconductor devices, w hen due
to decreasing size (from micron to Angstrom) atomic length scales a re reached
and the laws of quantum mechanics apply. Like chaotic motion in a ﬂuid,
quantum chaos may cause a similar phenomenon for the ﬂux of the ele ctric
current in a semiconductor.
What has the quantum action - the subject of this article - to do with the
aboveissues? Thequantumactionisanewconceptconcerningthef oundations
of quantum mechanics. Since de Broglie we know that the quantum wo rld has
apparently a dual face - a particle picture and a wave picture. The q uantum
action can be considered as a link between classical physics and quan tum
physics. This may be interpreted as if the quantum world has a third f ace -
a classical picture with a new interaction. Consequently, the quant um action
may be expected to be useful to better understand the relation b etween and
the transition from classical physics to quantum physics. In partic ular, there
are some very fruitful concepts in quantum physics, which are der ived from

classical physics: One example is the instanton solution in a quantum ﬁ eld
theory. Another example is quantum chaos.
On the other hand there are phenomena occuring in the quantum wo rld
which do not have a counter part in the classical world. A well known e xample
is tunneling: A double well potential with a barrier in the middle prohibits in
classical physics a transition from one minimum to the other if the ene rgy is
too small to overcome the barrier. However, in quantum physics a t ransition
does occur with a certain probability. It is noteworthy that tunnelin g and
instantons are closely related [3]. There are other systems, where transitions
are classically forbidden, due to some conserved quantity (other t han energy),
but quantum mechanical transitions are possible. This is known as dy namical
tunneling [4]. It has recently been realized experimentally [5, 6]. It tur ns
out that quantum chaos seems to facilitate dynamical tunneling. We suggest
that the quantum action [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] is an appropriate tool to in vestigate
phenomena on the borderline between classical and quantum physic s and to
analyze quantum tunneling, quantum instantons and quantum chao s.
In thefollowing we discuss theconcept of thequantum action. Inpa rticular,
we discuss analytical properties of the quantum action in the limit whe n the
time of a quantum mechanical transition goes to inﬁnity. As an examp le of the
use of the quantum action we discuss quantum instantons from a do uble well
potential and quantum chaos from the 2-D anharmonic oscillator. F inally, we
give an outlook on further use of the quantum action.
2.The problem of quantum chaos and quantum instantons. Chaos
is quite well understood in classical physics. Its origin in terms of non linear
dynamics has been investigated thoroughly in theoretical physics a nd math-
ematics. If one considers nature at the level of atoms, where the laws of
quantum mechanics (Q.M.) hold, chaotic phenomena are by far less we ll un-
derstood than in classical (macroscopic) physics [12, 13, 14, 15, 1 6]. Quantum
chaos is usually analyzed in terms of the level density of its energy sp ectrum.
This is based on a conjecure by Bohigas et al. [17] which states that t he level
density distribution (Poissonian vs. Wignerian) corresponds to an in tegrable
(non-chaotic) vs. chaotic quantum system. In classically chaotic s ystems,
phase space portraits, Poincar´ e sectioons, Lyapunov exponen ts and the KAM
theorem are very useful to analyze the chaotic behavior. Howeve r, those no-
tions have no direct counterpart in quantum systems. The problem is due to
thefact that inquantum mechanics one cannot specify with certain ty position
and momentum at the same time (Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation) . Hence
a sharp point in phase space has no meaning.
This is also the problem with the deﬁnition of quantum instantons. Rec all
that in classical physics the instanton is a solution in imaginary time whe re
a particle moves in a potential with degenerate minima, such that it st arts
at one minimum (sharp position and velocity zero) and goes over to an other
3
minimum (sharp position and velocity zero). Again boundary condition s are
sharp points in phase space with no direct analogon in Q.M.
Here we take the following approach: Via the quantum action one can pa-
rametrize quantum mechanical transition amplitudes (which contain all infor-
mation about the physics of the system). On the other hand, the q uantum
action has the same mathematical form as the classical action, a kin etic term
(proportional to velocity squared) and a local potential term. Ho wever, the
action parameters, like mass and potential are diﬀerent from the c lassical one,
in general. Starting from such quantum action then allows to constr uct a
phase space portrait and hence reintroduce the tools of classical chaos theory
to the quantum world.
Let us come back to the problem of a point in phase space used as initia l
condition. Recall in classical mechanics that equations of motions ar e ﬁxed
by specifying the dynamics (usually in terms of a diﬀerential equation ) and
by specifying initial conditions. Usually one speciﬁes position and veloc ity at
some initial time. A consequence of this type of boundary conditions is that
certain trajectories are forbidden. For example those where the energy is too
small to overcome a potential barrier. Moreover, this initial condit ion has no
direct analogon in Q.M. However, there is a simple way out: Consider cla ssical
mechanics with 2-point boundary conditions. I.e., one speciﬁes posit ions at
some initial and ﬁnal time. Then there are no classically forbidden tra jecto-
ries (sometimes even inﬁnitely many trajectories are possible). In q uantum
physics, there is a well deﬁned transition amplitude. Below we deﬁne t he
quantum action by use of two-point boundary conditions.
3.Postulate of quantum action. The quantum action [7] is deﬁned by the
following requirements. For a given classical action
S[x] =/integraldisplay
dtm

there is a quantum action
˜S[x] =/integraldisplay

which parametrizes the Q.M. transition amplitude

where ˜xcldenotes the classical path corresponding to the action ˜S. We require
2-point boundary conditions,
˜xcl(t=ti) =xi
˜xcl(t=tf) =xf.
˜Zstands for a dimensionful normalisation factor. Note: The parame ters of
the quantum action (mass, potential) are independent of the boun dary points
xf,xi, but depend on the transition time T=tf−ti. The same q-action
parametrizes all transition amplitudes for a given transition time.
The postulateleads tothequestion: Doessuchquantum actionexis t? Sofar
we have no general proof. However, the answer is aﬃrmative in the following
cases:
(a) Harmonic oscillator. In this case the classical action satisﬁes th e deﬁnition
of the quantum action [18, 7], hence both coincide.
(b) Arbitrary local potential, limit when transition time T→0: Then the
quantum action exists as it coincides with classical action.
(c) Arbitrary potential, imaginary time, limit when transition time T→ ∞
(equivalent to temperature going to zero): Then the quantum act ions exists,
beingdiﬀerentfromtheclassical action, ingeneral(aproofisgiven inRef.[11]).
4.Analytical properties of the quantum action. In this limit of large
imaginary time, the quantum action has a number of remarkable prop erties:
(i)TheWKBapproximationforthegroundstatewavefunctionbeco mesexact,
after replacing the classical action by the quantum action.
(ii) There is an analytic expression for the ground state wave funct ion in terms
of the quantum action.
(iii) The ground state energy coincides with the minimum of the quantu m
potential.
(iv) The ground state wave function has a maximum exactly at the sa me
position, where the quantum potential has a minimum.
(v) The quantum action allows also to reproduce energies and wave f unctions
of excited states. Example: The spectrum of the hydrogen atom, considering
the lowest energy states for given angular momentum.
Let us detail some of those results.
For physical and mathematical reasons, it is interesting to go from real time
over to imaganiary time. A mathematical reason is that the path inte gral for
the Q.M. transition amplitude then becomes well deﬁned (Wiener integ ral).
A physical reason is that the description of ﬁnite temperature phy sics requires
the use of imaginary time. Thus we make the following transition
t→ −it .

Then the action becomes the so-called Euclidean action

Let us recall the Feynman-Kac formula, which makes a statement a bout the
time evolution of the quantum system in the limit of large imaginary time.
In this limit the time evolution of a quantum system is determined by the
behavior of exp[ −HT//planckover2pi1] whenTgoes to∞. In particular, one has
e−HT//planckover2pi1−→T→∞|ψgr/angbracketrighte−EgrT//planckover2pi1/angbracketleftψgr|,
whereEgrandψgrarethe groundstate energy andwave function, respectively.
Now let us consider the case of a potential V(x) having a unique minimum
and obeying V(x)→ ∞whenx→ ±∞. We consider the Euclidean action
in the limit of large time. The trajectory minimizes the action. Because the
kinitic term and the potential term (by assumption) are positive, th is means
that the trajectory minimizes ﬂuctuations and stays as close as po ssible to the
bottom of the potential valley. This implies for T→ ∞,
˜V→˜Vmin,˜Tkin→0, ǫ=−˜Tkin+˜V→˜Vmin,
and

where the sign depends on initial and ﬁnal data. The transition amplit ude
then becomes

By comparison with the Feynman-Kac formula one obtains the followin g ana-
lytic expressions for the ground state energy and wave function, expressed in
terms of the quantum action,
Egr=˜Vmin, ψgr(x) =1
Ne−/integraltext|x|

2˜m(˜V(x′)−˜Vmin)//planckover2pi1. (5)
6 H. KR¨OGER
Combining this with the Schr¨ odinger equation leads to the following tr ansfor-
mation law
2m(V(x)−Egr) = 2˜m(˜V(x)−˜Vmin)−/planckover2pi1

dx2˜m(˜V(x)−˜Vmin)/radicalBig
2˜m(˜V(x)−˜Vmin)sgn(x).(6)
Although those results have been obtained in imaginary time, they ho ld also
in real time (ground state energy Egrand wave function ψgr(x) are the same
as in real time).
Eq.(5) shows that the minimum of the quantum potential coincides wit h
the ground state energy. Second, the position of the minimum of th e quantum
potential coincides with the position of the maximum of the ground st ate
wave function. This is shown in Fig.[1]. Hence the quantum potential giv es a
much better picture of the behavior of the quantum system than t he classical
potential, which does not share those properties.

The celebrated semi-classical WKB formula [Wentzel, Kramers and Br il-
louin (1926)] gives approximate solutions to wave function and tunn eling am-
plitude. As an example let us consider in 1-D a system with parity symme tric
”conﬁnement” potential (potential goes to + ∞when|x| → ∞). Assume that
the system is in the ground state. The WKB formula gives an approxim ate
expression for wave function at energy E=Egr

Comparingwiththeresultsfromsect.4, weseethattheWKBformula becomes
exact, when replacing parameters of classical action by those of t he quantum
action
m→˜m , V(x)→˜V(x),
and replacing the rational term in front by a constant (wave funct ion normal-
isation).
5.Excited states of hydrogen atom. Can the quantum action also give
analytical results for excited states? The answer is yes, if we cons ider excited
states being lowest energy states of a conserved quantum numbe r. As an
example let us consider the radial motion of the hydrogen atom in a se ctor
of ﬁxed angular momentum l >0. The potential has a centrifugal plus a
Coulomb term. Let us consider angular motion to be quantized. We ke ep the
angular momentum quantum number lﬁxed. In the Feynman-Kac limit the
transition amplitude is projected onto the state of lowest energy c ompatible
with quantum number l. The states of the hydrogen atom arecharacterized by
the quantum numbers n(principal quantum number) l(angular momentum)
wheren=l+1. There is also the magnetic quantum number m. The radial
potential is given by
Vl(r) =/planckover2pi12l(l+1)

r.
The exact energy of the excited states is given by
El=−EI
n2=−EI
(l+1)2, EI=me4
2/planckover2pi12≈13.6eV(ionisation energy) .
The corresponding wave function is given by

For the quantum action we make an ansatz
˜m=m ,˜Vl(r) =µ/r2−ν/r .
8 H. KR¨OGER
A transformation law [similar to Eq.(6)] determines the parameters o f the
q-action,
µ=/planckover2pi12

and the minimum of the quantum potential gives exactly the excitatio n ener-
gies

(l+1)2.
Again the wave function can be expressed in terms of the quantum a ction in a
way similar to Eq.(5), and reproduces the exact wave function φl. Moreover,
we observe that the excited state wave function φl(r) has its maximum where
the quantum potential ˜Vlhas its minimum. The quantum action has the same
structure as the classical action. Both, the centrifugal and the Coulomb term
get tuned.

andm= 1,/planckover2pi1= 1. The potential minima lie at a=±1. The potential barrier
has the height B= 1/2. The double well potential has a classical instanton
solution. It is obtained by solving the Euler-Lagrange equations of m otion of
the Euclidean classical action, with the initial conditions x(t=−∞) =−a,

For the quantum action we make the following ansatz,
˜S=/integraldisplay

k=0˜vkxk.
For example, at (imaginary) transition time T= 0.5 we ﬁnd the following
parameters for the quantum action ˜ m= 0.9961(2), ˜v0= 1.5710(17), ˜v1=
0.000(2), ˜v2=−0.745(6), ˜v3= 0.000(2), ˜v4= 0.493(3). By adding a constant,
the quantum potential can be expressed as a positive double well wit h minima
located at ±˜awith ˜a= 0.869(6). It has a barrier height ˜B= 0.281. It displays
”degenerate vacua”. Compared with the classical potential it is so fter, i.e. its
potential minima are closer to the origin and its barrier is also lower. Th e
quantum potential also has an instanton solution, corresponding t oT= 0.5,
given by
xT=0.5
inst(t) = ˜atanh[/radicalbig
2/˜m˜A˜a t]≈0.869 tanh[0.865t].

Similarly, we ﬁnd an instanton solution for any larger value of T. The quan-
tum instanton is obtained in the asymptotic limit T→ ∞. The evolution of
the instantons under variation of T, i.e. under variation of the temperature,
is depicted in Fig.[2]. It shows the transition from the classical instant on (at
inﬁnite temperature) to the quantum instanton (at zero tempera ture). One
observes that the quantum instanton is much softer than the clas sical instan-
ton.

7.Quantum chaos. The hydrogen atom in the presence of strong magnetic
ﬁelds has been explored experimentally and theoretically [17, 19, 20]. It dis-
plays quantum chaos via disorder in the spectrum. In the regime of h igh lying
excited states, where the system becomes semi-classical, Gutzwille r’s trace for-
mula has been applied successfully by Wintgen [20] to extract periodic orbit
information. Here we suggest to explore quantum chaos via the pha se space
generated by the quantum action. As a prototype system, we con sider a 2-dim
non-integrable Hamiltonian, with a classically chaotic counter part.
Our deﬁnition of quantum chaos is based on the concept of ’some’ ph ase
space related to quantum mechanics. The novel idea is to introduce this phase
space via the quantum action. Second, the quantum action depend s on the
transition time T, however, for large Tit converges asymptotically. More-
over, in this regime the existence of the quantum action has been es tablished
10 H. KR¨OGER
rigorously. Theregimeoflarge Tmakes physical sense, becausetheproperdef-
inition of Lyapunov exponents, one of the characteristics of chao tic dynamics,
involves the large time limit.
As an example, let us consider the following Hamiltonian
S=/integraldisplayT
0dt1
2m(˙x2+ ˙y2)+V(x,y)
V(x,y) =v2(x2+y2)+v22x2y2
m= 1, v2= 0.5, v22= 0.05.
The parameter v22controls the deviation from integrability. At v22= 0 the
system is integrable. The system corresponds to two uncoupled os cillators, the
corresponding quantum action then coincides with the classical act ion. One
expects that tuning the parameter v22, while keeping the other parameters
ﬁxed, thesystemwillbecomemorechaoticwhenincreasing v22. Itisinteresting
to ask: Does the quantum system also become more chaotic?
For the quantum action, we have made the following ansatz: It reﬂe cts the
time-reversal symmetry, parity conservation and symmetry und er exchange
x↔y:
˜S=/integraldisplayT
0dt1
2˜m(˙x2+ ˙y2)+˜V(x,y),
˜V= ˜v0+ ˜v2(x2+y2)+ ˜v22x2y2+ ˜v4(x4+y4).
We also have included in the quantum action terms like ˙ x˙y,xy,xy3+x3y,
x2y4+x4y2,x4y4. Numerically, those coeﬃcients were found to be small
(compared to machine precision or zero within error bars).
An example of Poincar´ e sections for the classical system and the q uantum
systen are shown in Fig.[3]. The quantum Poincar´ e section correspo nds to
transition time T= 4.5. The energy has been chosen to be E= 10. One
can observe some diﬀerences between the classical and the quant um system.
Further numerical studies [10] have shown the following behavior: For small
v22, Poincar´ e sections of classical and quantum physics are quite simila r. With
increase of energy, both display mixed dynamics and become more ch aotic.
Also, with increase of energy diﬀerences between classical and qua ntum phasse
spacebecome morepronounced. Islands ofregular behavior diﬀer inshapeand
position. Quantitatively, one observes that the value of ˜ v22(quantum action)
is smaller than the corresponding value v22of the classsical action. Because
this parametyers measures the deviation from integrability, this hin ts to the
possibility that the quantum system is ”less” chaotic thanthe classic al system.
A more detailed analysis is called for.
8.Outlook: Further use of quantum action. In cosmology, the inﬂation-
ary scenario describes the early universe. Inﬂation involves poten tials with

sical action vs. quantum action.
several minima and instanton solutions. The instanton starts out a s a quan-
tum instanton and eventually turns into a classical instanton. This h as eﬀects
on the subsequent formation of galaxies. The quantum action allows to search
for new minima inthe quantum potential, which may beabsent in the clas sical
potential.
In condensed matter physics, superconducting quantum interfe rence devices
(SQUID)havebeenusedbyFriedmanetal. todemonstrateexperim entallythe

Josephson junctions. The SQUID potential has a double-well stru cture. The
quantum action allows to construct a quantum potential and analyz e quantum
superposition in terms of such quantum potential.
In atomic physics, Steck et al. and Hensinger et al. have demonstra ted
experimentally the phenomenon of dynamical tunneling (where the c lassical
transition is forbidden due to some conserved quantity diﬀerent fr om energy).
It has been realized by arrays of cold atoms. It has been observed that the
presence of quantum chaos enhances the dynamical tunneling tra nsition. It
would be interesting to reexamine dynamical tunneling using the phas e space
portrait constructed from the quantum action.

volves potentials of a double well structure. The quantum action ca n be used
to study the formation of such macromolecules.

are the Pauli matrices. BandHare transverse and

ZN= tre−βHN(2)
whereβis the inverse temperature. In the case where H= 0 this model has
been exactly solved [1] [3]. The free energy is [2]

(in the limit H→0). In fact, it will be shown that in this limit the ground

We shall now give a proof of (9).
2.1 The case B >2Jd
We use the method of steepest descent to prove this result, follow ing the
calculation by Baxter [7]. We let H= 0 in (8). Clearly the integrand in
(8) may be multiplied by a factor exp a(/summationtextN

In this way (11) can be written as

expN(βB)2
4(a+is)
exp[−zTVz+N(a+is)]ds dNz. (13)
We now choose the constant aso large that all the eigenvalues of Vhave
positive real part. This allows us to change the order of integration , and we
may now write (13) as
ZN=π3N/2−1

We need to calculate the eigenvalues of V. SinceVis cyclic, this is easily
done. We let the lattice be d-dimensional hypercubic, so that
N=Ld(15)
for some positive integer L. It now follows from (12) that the eigenvalues are
λ(ω1,...,ωd) =a+is−βJd/summationdisplay
j=1cosωj (16)
where each ωjtakes the values {2πk/L}L−1

Sinceφapproaches + ∞aswapproaches 0 or + ∞along the real line, φhas
a minumum at some w0, 0< w0<∞. Thusℜφhas a maximum at w0along
the line ( w0−i∞,w0+i∞). SinceB >2Jd, we may choose c=w0. We now
use the method of steepest descent (see for instance Murray [8]) , by letting
Napproach inﬁnity. In this way, the free energy is
f=−β−1lim
N→∞N−1logZN

2βln(π/βJ)−β−1φ(w0). (21)
Now

and thus the ground state energy is

2.2 The case B≤2Jd
In this case we let H >0, so instead of (13) we have
ZN=πN/2−1

a+is/parenrightBigN
expN(βB)2
4(a+is)
exp[−zTVz+hTz+N(a+is)]ds dNz, (24)
whereh=βH(1,...,1). We change variables to t=z−1
2V−1h, and rotate
the axes in ( t1,...,tN) to make Vdiagonal. Thus we get
ZN=πN/2−1
2/integraldisplay∞
−∞/parenleftBig1
a+is/parenrightBigN
(detV)−1/2expN(βB)2
4(a+is)

Thus
ZN=πN/2

We proceed in the same way as before, taking the limit N→ ∞and then
β→ ∞. In this case w0→0 asH→0. The free energy is thus
f=−Jd−B2
4Jd. (28)
This ends the proof.
3 Discussion
Comparison of (5) and (9) shows that the susceptibilites of the two mod-
els atB= 0 are equal when d= 1; that is −∂2f∞/∂B2|B=0= 1/2Jand
−∂2f0,∞/∂B2|B=0= 1/2Jd. While the Quantum Ising Model has only been
exactly solved in the one dimensional case, the quantum spherical m odelcan
be solved in any ﬁnite dimension.

Classical physics fails where quantum physics prevails. This comm on understanding 
applies to quantum phenomena that are acknowledged to be beyond the reach of classical 
physics.  Here, we make an attempt at weak ening this solid belief that  classical physics is unfit  
to explain the quantum world. The trial run is the quantization of the free radiation field  that 
will be addressed by following  a strategy that is free from operators or quantum -mechanical 
concepts .  
 2 The intimate laws of nature fall under the realm of quantum physics [1-3]. Classical 
physics seems to be out of that territory controlled by quantum laws , despite the fact that most 
of our knowledge (and most of our world ) is classica l. This divide dates back to those years 
when new me thods were conceived to capture  the meaning  of what could not be explain ed in 
terms of classical concepts . However, the question of whether the divide between quantum 
and classical  physi cs is smaller than it seems is stimulating and challenging.  
The question motivates  the current work . In particular, we consider one of the most known  
problem s in quantum mechanics, the quantization of the free radiation field  [1-3]. The 
quantization is usually realized according to the correspondence principle  of quantum 
mechanics : classical physics should be recovered by the quantum laws under the macroscopic 
limit . It is  for this reason  that we can set up the correspondence that conne cts a series of 
harmonic oscillators to the free radiation field. The procedure is very popular and can be 
found in any textb ook on the subject . The result is that the energy of the  radiation field is 
)21( /n
 where 
n  is an integer that takes the meaning of photon number, 
  is the 
reduced Planck constant and  
 is the angular frequency  of the field.  
In this work, we want to reproduce this fundamental law by means of a  procedure that is  
free from traditional quantum -mechanical concepts . The key idea  is related  to the classical 
multipole expansion of the electromagnetic field  [4] and, s urprisingly, although we do not 
rely on the help provided by  the quantum harmonic oscillator, we are able to find the 
quantum -mechanical result  provided that we keep ourselves from establishing an immediate 
connection of the running index 
n  to the photon number . To this end , the term of energy 
quanta will  be preferred in reference to the procedure illustrated in the current work, whereas 
the term photons remain s for the quantum -mechanical  procedure of quantization . 
 3 The alternative  quantization procedure starts where the quantum correspondence breaks i n. 
That is at the point where the vector potential  is used to establish the correspondence of the 
cycle -averaged classical energy with the Hamiltonian of the multitude of quantum oscillators. 
In general, the classical -averaged energy is written as

The scheme behind Eqs. ( 2)-(5) is manifest.  Unlike the quantum  approach  where 
everything revolves around the ve ctor potential , we prefer to handle  the true observab le, that 
is, the electric field . In addition, we avoid the plane -wave expansion typical of the quantum -
mechanical procedure. This choice  reduces the whole problem to a specific form of wave 
propagation . Our choice is differe nt and explained below . Nonetheless, we keep the fact  that 
 4 the double time  derivative transforms the right -hand side of Eq. ( 5) into 
),(2t Eks,rk , 
having assumed that  
ck k . With these preliminaries, we are prepared for the pr ocedure 
that does not require quantum -mechanical operators.  
The procedure is not totally new. It is partially taken  from the classical multipole 
expansion of electromagnetic fields  [pag. 429 of Ref. 4], according to which the spatial 
dependences  are encoded in the well -known Helmholtz equation  
0),( ),(2 2   t Ekt Es, s, r rk k
                                            (6) 
which is familiar to many in mathematics and physics .  
The general so lution of Eq. ( 5) is achieved by introducing polar coordinates 
r , 
 and 
  
and contains special functions.  The radial component is given by spherical Bessel and 
Neumann functions [pag. 425 of of Ref. 4]. The angular de pendence  is instead determined  by 
the spherical harmonics  that form an orthonormal basis in the Hilbert space of square -
integrable functions  [pag. 108 of Ref. 4]. These  special functions appear in classical 
electrodynamics  [4], classical optics  [5], acoustics  [6], geophysics  [7] and beyond these 
examples, they are central to the quantum -mechanical determination of orbital angular 
moment a (see Ref . 1, pp. 519-523). Soon w e will discover  that the spherical harmonics are 
central to  this demonstration too.  
The demonstration is  given for one solution of Eq. ( 6). The solution is chosen regular at the 
origin (we are in the free space , i.e, without singularities , and the field has to be regula r!). 
This means  that the solution can be  written in dependence on the generic order 
n  of the 
spherical Bessel function

 6 where 
R  is the radius of the quantization volume 
V  that is also present in the class ical-
quantum corr espondence that creates the well -known quantum -mechanical result for the 
energy.  
It is undeniable that Eq. ( 10) has something that reminds us of the quantum -mechanical  
result . We disregard he radial integral  
nR at the mom ent. We anticipate that its dependence 
on 
n  is very weak and disappear s when we consider the limit of 
1kR . In other words, we 
have found the 
21/ n  rule by applying a simple p rocedure that i s well known in 
electrodynamics [ 4]. The difference with the quantum -mechanical  procedure  is on the 
meaning of the number 
n . In the quantum -mechanical  approach , 
n is the eigenvalue of the  
photon number operator 
s,s,aˆaˆk k . In the current attempt , 
n is the number of spherical 
harmonics of opposite secondary index 
m . We do not want to make a direct connection to the 
photon number , nevertheless,  this classical procedure finds a quantization rule that looks like 
the quantum -mechanical rule.  
There is something mor e besides  the similarity of the 
21/ n  rule. It concerns th e vacuum 
field. Indeed, the most prominent result of Eq. ( 10) is what could be called the classical 
vacuum field connected t o the zero -point energy for 
0n . This condition leaves room for the 
fundamental (
0m ) spherical harmonic  only (monopole term) . Its complete spherical 
symmetry  supports the view that the vacuum field is spatially isotropic  and, by looking at Eq. 
(8), its contribution to the energy counts for one unit instead of the elusive half-photon of the 
quantum -mechanical approach . The  value  of 
2/1  in Eq. ( 10) is, indeed , accidental  because 
its appearance is caused  by the cycle average  of Eq. ( 9) and has nothing to do with the 
mysterious energy splitting suggested by the quantum -mechanical un derstanding of the 
vacuum energy . 
 7 Furthermore , Eq. ( 10) identifies a peculiar  value of reference for the elementary electric 
field amplitude 
0E  associated with each energy quantum . In this manner, we can picture the 
energy of the electromagnetic field in relation to a unique value of the electric field . By 
contrast , higher energy levels are not given by  a larger value of 
0E . Higher energy levels are 
realized by the excitation of spherical harmonics of higher order than the fundamental. This is 
in marked contrast with what is believed to characterize the classical view of the ra diation 
field and we have found that a pure classical argument agrees with quantum mechanics on the 
idea of what energy  is. 
Another consequence of Eq. (10) is relative to the concept of state. For instance, the 
vacuum state o f 
0n  and 
0m  corresponds to the monopole  term and this  implies that any 
point in the space is a source o f the vacuum.  Next, the one -particle  state o f 
1n  corresponds 
to a state of the first three harmonics with 
0m  and 
1m  (dipole)  as if the energy quanta 
had an internal structure consisting in their  own spin . This is not far from the quantum -
mechanical picture. The state with 
2n  corresponds to a state of the first five harmonics 
with 
0m  and the possible combination of 
2 ,1m  (quadrupole) and so o n for 
3n . 
The final image  we have from what has been a ccomplished  so far is rather promising and 
we go on with the  calculation . 
The procedure leading to Eq. ( 10) is very simple  and hinges on the  solution of the 
Helmho ltz equation for the electric field in place  of plane -wave expansions of  the vector 
potential . How ever, we did not take into proper account the  problem atic role  of the radial 
integral 
nR . We do it now.  
The radial part of Eq. ( 7) is made of multipole contribution s that multiply spheri cal waves . 
It means that , when 
nR  is calculated , we obtain a term that depends linearly on the radius 
R  
plus oscillating terms. The result can be written  in closed form , but we are especially 
 8 concerned  about  the limit of 
1kR  that corresponds t o the cases of practical interest . 
Fortunately, the great value of 
kR  suppresses the oscillating terms and we find that 
nR  is 
independent  from 
n . In this case, being

Overview talk at the 28th Solvay Conference on Physics
“The Physics of Quantum Information”
Brussels, 19-21 May 2022
1. Introduction
This Solvay Conference on Physics provides a welcome opportunity t o assess recent
scientiﬁc progress and to reﬂect on the challenges and opportunit ies before us.
Solvay Conferences had a stirring inﬂuence on advances in quantum physics during
the 20th century, going back to the very ﬁrst in 1911. Those adva nces transformed
our understanding of nature, and also led the way to remarkable te chnologies such
as lasers, atomic clocks, magnetic resonance imaging, and billions of t ransistors on
a single microchip.
Such technologies, though undeniably impressive and impactful, bar ely scratch
the surface of how quantum theory reshapes our view of what’s po ssible in the
universe. Now, for the ﬁrst time in human history, we are developing and perfecting
the tools to create and precisely control very complex states of m any interacting
particles, states so complex that we cannot eﬃciently simulate them with our most
powerful existing computers or anticipate their behavior using cur rently known
theoretical ideas. As our ability to control the quantum world matu res, profound
scientiﬁc discoveries and powerful technologies will surely ensue.
The rapidlyunfolding developmentsin quantuminformation sciencema kenow a
particularly apt time for a Solvay Conference on The Physics of Quan tum Informa-
tion. This topic encompasses four intertwined themes to be target ed in subsequent
sessions: Quantum computer science,1,2quantum hardware,3,4quantum matter,5,6
and quantum gravity.7,8For each theme I will provide some historical background,
then comment on the current status and future prospects.

2. Background
Modeling computation
The fundamental theory of computation builds on foundations ere cted by Turing in
the 1930s.9Turing deﬁned a computation in terms of an idealized physical proces s
involving manipulation of symbols on a movable tape, and his model beca me widely
accepted as a correct characterization of functions that are in p rinciple computable
in the physical world, an assertion known as the Church-Turing the sis.
A more reﬁned notion, eﬃcient computation, drew attention in the 1 970s, ignit-
ing the theoryofcomputationalcomplexity.10–12It became acceptedthat aproblem
can be solved eﬃciently if the number of steps on a Turing machine sca les like a
polynomial in the size of the input to the problem, the so-called exten ded Church-
Turing thesis. By broad consensus, these are the problems that a re feasible to solve
in practice. They are said to belong to a complexity class called P, for p olynomial
time.
Problems in the complexity class NP are those such that a solution, on ce found,
can be eﬃciently veriﬁed by a Turing machine, and it’s generally believed that
NP contains hard problems that are outside P. It was noticed that a large family
of problems, like combinatorial optimization problems, are in a class ca lled NP-
complete – these may be regarded as the hardest problems in the cla ss NP.10–12
WebelievethatNPalsocontainsproblemsoutsidePwhicharenotNP-c omplete.
Finding the prime factors of a large composite integer is a famous pro blem thought
to be of this type.
As a practical application of complexity theory, public key cryptosy stems were
proposed in the 1970s, based on problems like factoring that are ou tside P but not
NP-complete.13,14These schemes are heavily used today to protect the privacy of
electronic communication, and are based on the presumption that a computation
that could break the protocol is too hard to carry out in practice.
Quantifying information
Information theory builds on foundations erected by Shannon in th e 1940s.15Shan-
non quantiﬁed the information conveyed by a message according to how much the
messagecouldbecompressedtofewerbitswithoutanylossofcont ent. Healsoquan-
tiﬁed how much information can be transmitted from sender to rece iver through a
noisy communication channel such that the information can be deco ded with neg-
ligible probability of error by the receiver.
This theory led to the notion of an error-correcting code which can protect
redundantly encoded information against the damaging eﬀects of n oise;16this in
turn led to results establishing that computations can be performe d reliably even
when the computing hardwareis imperfect.17Error-correctingcodes are also vitally
important in modern communication systems, like mobile phone cellular n etworks.

Quantum information
The origins of quantum information theory can be traced back to ob servations by
Einstein and collaborators in the 1930s,18who noticed that correlations among
parts of a quantum system can have counterintuitive properties, a phenomenon
called “quantum entanglement” by Schr¨ odinger.19John Bell formalized this notion
inthe1960s20byestablishingthatplayerswhosharequantumentanglementcanw in
a cooperative game with a higher success probability if they share en tangled qubits
as opposed to classically correlated bits.21,22In this sense quantum entanglement
is a valuable resource that can be consumed to perform useful tas ks.
In the 70s and 80s it was recognized that quantum communication, f or exam-
ple by sending photons through optical ﬁber or free space, can be advantageous in
cryptography, as securitycan be based on principles ofquantum p hysics ratherthan
limitations on the computational resources available to potential ad versaries.23–25
The crucial principle is that unknown quantum states, in contrast t o classical bits,
cannot be copied accurately,26,27and in fact acquiring information about the con-
tent of quantum signals produces an unavoidable disturbance which is in principle
detectable.
Also in the 70s, the general theory of measuring and processing qu antum states
was developed, including fundamental limits on how much classical info rmation can
be acquired when a quantum system is measured.28,29
Quantum computation
That properties of a complex highly correlated quantum system of m any particles
are hard to compute is an old observation already known to the pione ers of quan-
tum mechanics. In the early 1980s, Feynman30and Manin31articulated the idea
that properties that are hard to calculate with a conventional com puter might be
easy if we compute with a quantum device instead. This gave rise to a r evision
of the extended Church-Turing thesis, which in its revised form can be informally
stated as, “A quantum computer can eﬃciently simulate any proces s that occurs in
nature.”32It is now widely believed, though not proven from ﬁrst principles, tha t
quantum computers have an exponential advantage over conven tional computers
for some problems, potentially including problems of interest in chemis try and ma-
terials science. That is, computations that can be performed in a tim e that scales
polynomially with system size using a quantum computer require a time t hat scales
exponentially using a conventional computer.
It was also found theoretically that quantum algorithms have a supe rpolyno-
mial advantage over the best known classical algorithms for proble ms of interest in
modern cryptography, such as ﬁnding the prime factors of a large composite inte-
ger.33–35In addition, it is known that quantum computers can speed up exhau stive
search for a solution to a combinatorial optimization problem, but in t hat case the
speedup is quadratic, meaning that the quantum time to solution sca les like the
square root of the classical time.36,37

What is a quantum computer?
A mathematical model of an ideal quantum computer was formulate d, the quantum
circuit model, which has these ﬁve essential ingredients.38(1) A physical system
harboring many qubits, such that the qubit number can be scaled up ward as needed
to solve problems of increasing size. (2) The ability to prepare simple s tandard
initial states of the qubits, in eﬀect to cool the system to a state w ith low entropy.
(3) A universal set of entangling quantum operations, called quant um gates, each
actingontwoormorequbits, universalmeaningthat bycomposingm anysuchgates
in succession we can approximate arbitraryunitary transformatio nsacting on many
qubits. (4) A classical computer that eﬃciently translates a proble m into a suitable
circuit of quantum gates. And (5) the ability to measure qubits in a st andard basis
to read out classical bits providing the result of the computation. T he eﬃciently
solvable problems are those that can be solved with high success pro bability using
a number of quantum gates that scales polynomially with the problem’s input size.
Other physically reasonable models of quantum computation were als o studied,
such as the topological39,40and adiabatic41,42models, and shown to be equivalent
to the quantum circuit model, thus lending further support to the q uantum version
of the extended Church-Turing thesis.
One should appreciate that all the features of the quantum circuit model can be
simulated by an conventional classical computer, if equipped by a ra ndom number
generator to capture the nondeterministic nature of the ﬁnal qu antum measure-
ment. All the classical computer needs to do is keep track of a vect or in a Hilbert
space as we act on the vector with a sequence of matrices. For the ﬁnal readout, it
projects the vector onto a standard set of axes, and assign pro babilities to the dif-
ferent measurement outcomes accordingly. Since a (randomized) classical computer
can do whatever a quantum computer does, there is no diﬀerence in computability
— whatever is computable by a quantum computer is computable by a c lassical
computer as well.
Theimportantdistinction betweenthequantumand classicalmodels is allabout
eﬃciency . In general, for the classical computer to simulate the quantum co mputer,
it has to deal with vectors in a space whose dimension is exponential in the number
of qubits. For the hardest problem instances, all known classical m ethods for doing
this simulation requireresourcesthat scaleexponentially with the nu mber ofqubits.
Quantum hardware
After the discovery of Shor’s factoring algorithm in 1994, interest in quantum com-
puting exploded, igniting pursuit of possible approaches to constru cting hardware
that could meet the ﬁve criteria enumerated above, at least to a re asonable ap-
proximation. And it was noticed that some technologies that were alr eady being
developed for other reasons could be adapted for the purpose of coherent quantum
information processing.
For example, motivated by the quest for more precise clocks, tools had been

developed for cooling and manipulating individual electrically charged a toms using
laser ﬁelds, which led to ion-trap quantum processors.43,44Josephson junctions,
nonlinear elements in superconducting circuits which were being used in high preci-
sion magnetometers, led to superconducting quantum processor s.45–47Experience
with nanoscale electrical circuits resulted in the ability to isolate and m anipulate
spins ofsingleelectrons.48,49High eﬃciencysourcesanddetectorsfor singlephotons
opened the possibility ofprocessorsbased onphotonics.50Methods fortrapping and
cooling neutral atoms led to tunable simulations of strongly interact ing quantum
matter.51,52Later, opticaltweezersprovidedan opportunity to build program mable
simulators based on arrays of highly excited neutral atoms.53–56These and other
approaches to quantum hardware are still being developed and are steadily advanc-
ing.
Currently the two most advanced quantum computing technologies are ion
traps3,57and superconducting circuits.4,58In an ion trap, each qubit is a single
electrically charged atom, which can be in either its ground state or a long-lived
excited state. Tens of qubits can be stored in a linear array, and th e state prepa-
ration, readout, and single-qubit quantum gates can all be achieve d by addressing
an ion with a stable laser. To perform entangling two-qubit gates, on e manipulates
the normal modes of vibration of ions in the trap using laser ﬁelds — a t wo-qubit
gate can be executed on any pair of ions in tens of microseconds.
To scaleup to largersystems, one envisionsmodulartrapping region s, connected
together by optical interconnects or by shuttling ions from one tr apping region to
another.
In a superconducting quantum computer, of order 100 qubits can be arrangedin
a two-dimensional array, with nearest-neighbor couplings among t he qubits. These
qubits, called transmons, are in eﬀect artiﬁcial atoms that must be carefully fab-
ricated and frequently calibrated. One reads out a transmon by co upling it to a
microwave resonator, and single-qubit quantum gates are execut ed by addressing
the qubit with microwave pulses. Two-qubit gates can be performed by various
means, for example by tuning the frequencies of a pair of qubits into and out of
resonance, or by driving one qubit at the frequency of another. A two-qubit gate
takes tens of nanoseconds.
For scaling up to larger systems, one must address the challenge of dealing
with many microwave control lines, and to improve gate ﬁdelities, bet ter materials,
fabrication quality, and possibly alternative qubit designs would all be helpful.
By now, quantum processorshaveadvanced to the stage wheret hey can perform
tasks that are challenging to simulate using classical computers. In particular, one
can sample from the output probability distribution of randomly chos en circuits
with 60 qubits and over 20 cycles of entangling two-qubit gates.59–61Though this
speciﬁc task is not of intrinsic practical interest, such experiment s have been useful,
byprovidingnewbenchmarksforcircuitﬁdelity, solidifyingourunder standingofthe
global features of circuit noise, and provoking improvements in clas sical simulation

methods.62
Quantum error correction
When Shor’s algorithm was discovered, and interest in quantum comp uting surged,
there was widespread and understandable skepticism regarding wh ether large-scale
quantum computingwould everbe practical.63–65Quantumsystemshavethe incon-
venient property that observing a quantum state inevitably distur bs the state in an
uncontrolled way, so interactions with the environment cause quan tum information
to decay rapidly, a phenomenon called decoherence. To execute a q uantum com-
putation reliably we must keep the information we process nearly per fectly isolated
from the outside world to prevent decoherence, which is quite diﬃcu lt because our
hardware can never be perfect.
It was quickly discovered that, at least in principle, hardware imperf ections
can be overcome with suitable software based on what we call quant um error-
correcting codes.66–69The crucial idea is that we can protect quantum information
by storing it nonlocally, encoding it in a very highly entangled form such that when
the environment interacts with the parts of the system locally, it ac quires negligible
information about the encoded quantum state and so need not dam age the state.
Furthermore, we learned how to process eﬃciently quantum inform ation that is
encoded in this highly entangled way.70It follows that, if errors in a quantum
computer are suﬃciently rare and not too strongly correlated, we can simulate an
ideal quantum computation eﬃciently using a noisy quantum compute r.71–77
The most promising protocol for error-corrected quantum comp uting in the rel-
atively near term is based on Kitaev’s surface code,78which has two advantages: it
can tolerate a relatively high physical error rate,79–81and it requires only geomet-
rically local processing in a two-dimensional layout. Even so, the ove rhead cost of
error correction, in both the number of physical qubits needed an d the number of
physical gates, is quite daunting. One can plausibly anticipate runnin g algorithms
for a few hundred protected logical qubits that would surpass the best conventional
computers for some problems of practical interest, but to achiev e suﬃciently reli-
ability the number of physical qubits might be in the millions. That’s a big le ap
from the devices we expect to have in the next few years, with hund reds of physical
qubits.
Quantum matter
Deep connections between quantum information and quantum matt er emerged
with the discovery of topological order82(initially in fractional quantum Hall sys-
tems83,84), which we now recognize as a manifestation of long-range entangle ment
in a quantum phase of matter.85By long-range entanglement, we mean that the
time needed to prepare the quantum phase, using spatially local ope rations in a
quantum computer and starting with an unentangled state, scales with the total
August 18, 2022 0:9 ws-procs961x669 WSPC Proceedings - 9.61 in x 6.69in Preskill˙Solvay28˙Overview page 7

size of the system. Furthermore, topologically ordered phases of matter may be
fruitfully viewed as quantum error-correcting codes which concea l nonlocally en-
coded quantum information.78Symmetry-protected topological phases were also
discovered,86–88for which the time to prepare the quantum state scales with sys-
tem size ifall localoperationsin the quantum circuit arerequiredto s atisfyspeciﬁed
symmetries.
It wasdiscoveredthat groundstates ofquantum systemsoften obey an entangle-
ment “area law,” meaning that the amount of entanglement between the particles
inside and outside of a speciﬁed ball-shaped region scales not like the t otal number
of particles in the region, but rather like the number of particles nea r the boundary
of the region.89–91This led to new methods for simulating quantum many-body
systems on classical computers based on tensor networks, which exploit this entan-
glement structure to improve substantially on previous methods.92–95And it was
noticed that entanglement, when quantiﬁed by the entropy of the marginal quan-
tum state for the particles in a region, has universal properties th at can be used to
identify distinct quantum phases of matter.96–98
The computational hardness of preparing quantum ground state s was studied,
and it was argued convincingly that in some cases this is a hard problem for quan-
tum computers;99this hardness can persist even for translationally invariant one-
dimensional systems,100though admittedly such computationally intractable quan-
tum many-body systems may have exotic interactions that are not necessarily of
practicalphysicalinterest. At anyrate, accordingtothe quant umextended Church-
Turing thesis, these ground states that areintractable for quan tum computers could
not arise in nature by any feasible physical process.
Quantum information has also provided a fresh perspective on the b ehavior of
strongly chaotic quantum systems, which we now view through the le ns of entan-
glement dynamics.101Information that is imprinted locally on a quantum system
quickly spreads, becoming encoded in the form of quantum entangle ment shared by
many particles, and hence invisible to local observers who have acce ss to just a few
particles at a time. This entanglement spreading can be eﬃciently simu lated by
quantum computers,102but is beyond the reach of known classical computational
methods, which cannot succinctly encode or eﬃciently simulate highly entangled
many-particle quantum states.
Quantum gravity
The connection between quantum gravity and quantum information can be traced
back to Hawking’s 1974 discovery that due to quantum eﬀects black holes emit
thermal radiation, arising because of quantum entanglement betw een the inside
and outside of the black hole’s event horizon.103This led to a quantitative rela-
tionship between the area of the event horizon and the black hole’s e ntropy,104a
measure of how much quantum information the black hole can store. These results
anticipated the area law for entanglement entropy in condensed ma tter physics that
August 18, 2022 0:9 ws-procs961x669 WSPC Proceedings - 9.61 in x 6.69in Preskill˙Solvay28˙Overview page 8
8
would be discovered years later. Furthermore, the entropy of a b lack hole is aston-
ishingly large — for example, the entropy of a solar mass black hole, wh ich is just
a few kilometers across, is 20 orders of magnitude larger than the e ntropy of the
sun. Indeed black holes, though remarkably simple objects as desc ribed by classi-
cal gravitation theory,105,106are quantum-mechanically the most complex objects
nature allows, as quantiﬁed by the black hole’s information storage c apacity.
Holographic duality, discovered in the 1990s, established that, at le ast in nega-
tively curved anti-de Sitter space, quantum gravity in bulk quantum spacetime is
equivalent to a nongravitational quantum ﬁeld theory in one lower dim ension that
residesonthe boundaryofthe spacetime.107And itturned outthat the bulk geome-
try isencodedon the boundaryby thestructureofthe quantume ntanglementin the
boundarytheory.108Furthermore, the holographicdictionarywhichmapslocalbulk
observables to the corresponding highly nonlocal observables on t he boundary was
recognized as the encoding map of a kind of quantum error-correc ting code.109,110
So we can regard the geometry of spacetime itself as an emergent f eature arising
from underlying quantum entanglement, which is intrinsically robust w ith respect
to some deformations of the boundary theory.
The entanglement dynamics of black holes was studied, and it was con jectured
that black holes are the most eﬃcient scramblers of quantum inform ation that
nature will allow.111,112Here, too, studies ofinformation scramblingthat originated
in studies of black hole physics stirred growing interest in how informa tion becomes
scrambled in other quantum many-body systems that are more acc essible in the
laboratory.113–115
The entropy of the Hawking radiation emitted by an evaporating blac k hole,
which tracksthe evolvingquantum entanglement of the radiationwit h the hole, was
studied quantitatively,116,117and calculations conﬁrmed that the entropy evolves
as expected if the evaporation process is correctly described by u nitary quantum
theory.118Rather unexpectedly, this unitary behavior can be captured by se miclas-
sical computations without reference to the microscopic details of quantum gravity.
Such results indicate that black hole physics is profoundly nonlocal; o ne can in
principle access the black hole interior by manipulating radiation that is far away,
but only by performing quantum operations which are of such high co mputational
complexity as to be infeasible in practice.119
Connections
The discussion so far has already illustrated the many cross-conne ctions among the
scientiﬁc themes that are represented at this conference. For e xample, information
scrambling is now studied in quantum computing circuits, in chaotic man y-particle
systems, and in black holes. Quantum error correction, introduce d for the purpose
of extending quantum computing to large systems, is also relevant t o topological
phases of matter, and to the holographic correspondence in quan tum gravity. Com-
putational complexity, the study of the hardness of computation al problems, turns
August 18, 2022 0:9 ws-procs961x669 WSPC Proceedings - 9.61 in x 6.69in Preskill˙Solvay28˙Overview page 9

out to be relevant to preparation of topological quantum phases o f matter, and also
to the geometry of the black hole interior. These are a few examples among many
such connections.
3. Status and prospects
Where are we now?
Coming back to quantum computing technology, what is the status t oday? There
are twocentral questions about quantum computing, which could a lreadyhavebeen
articulated 40 years ago. How will we scale up to quantum computing s ystems that
can solve hard problems? And how can we best make use of that comp utational
power in science and in industry? In my view, both questions are wide o pen. How
we direct our eﬀort should be guided by that realization.
One may ask, what should we do with the noisy intermediate-scale qua ntum
computers that we have now?120Two obvious answers are: We should use near-
term quantum computers to learn how to build more powerful quant um computers
that can have a practical impact. And we should seek a clearer unde rstanding of
how those practical quantum computers can eventually be used.
Even if broadly useful quantum computers are still a ways oﬀ, much can be
accomplished over the next ﬁve years or so. In that time frame we c an expect to see
encouraging progress toward scalable fault-tolerant quantum co mputing. And we
can anticipate scientiﬁc discoveries enabled by programmable quant um simulators
and circuit-based quantum computers.
Progress toward quantum error correction
What would constitute notable progresstoward fault-tolerant qu antum computing?
We need to be able to do repeated rounds of accurate error syndr ome measurement
for quantum error correction. And we would like to see concrete ev idence that
quantum memory times continue to improve sharply as we include more and more
physical qubits to encode each protected logical qubit.
The ion trappers could justiﬁably protest that they don’t care ver y much about
quantum memory times, because their atomic qubits already have ex traordinarily
long lifetimes. That’s true. But for all currently foreseen platform s it is crucial
to achieve much higher ﬁdelity for entangling two-qubit logical gates — only then
will we be able to run powerful quantum algorithms. What we may hope to see in
the near term are logical two-qubit gates, protected by quantum error correction,
with much higher ﬁdelity than our best physical two-qubit gates, as well as solid
evidence that logical gate ﬁdelities continue to improve sharply as th e code block
increases in size. That has not yet been accomplished.
What is the status now? There has been exciting recent progress t oward quan-
tum error correction; I’ll highlight two contributions, one from Goo gle and one from

Honeywell (now called Quantinuum).a
Google investigated the quantum repetition code, using up to 21 qub its in the
Sycamore processor, 11 in the code block and 10 ancilla qubits for er ror syndrome
readout.121Importantly, this is not a full-ﬂedged quantum error-correcting c ode —
it protects against dephasing errors but not against bit ﬂips. None theless, it was
an impressive demonstration. They did up to 50 consecutive rounds of syndrome
measurement, each taking about 1 microsecond, with most of that time devoted to
resetting the ancilla qubits to preparefor the next round ofsyndr ome measurement.
They observed that the rate of logical errors due to dephasing de creased by about
a factor of 10 each time the code distance increased by 4, for exam ple as the code
length increased from 3 to 7 and from 7 to 11. That wasin accord with expectations
given the noise in their device.

cycle times for the superconducting and ion trap devices. As quant um computing
advances, and the time on the wall clock for running an algorithm bec omes an
increasingly important consideration, that diﬀerence may loom large . Quantinuum

much of the time budget of their circuit.
Unfortunately, gateerrorratesin theGoogleandHoneywellmach ines, andother
current devices,123,124are still too high for quantum error correction to improve
two-qubit logical gate ﬁdelities.
Fault-tolerance with the surface code
The best currently known prospect for scaling up quantum comput ing in the rela-
tively near term is based on the surface code, introduced by Alexei Kitaev over 25
years ago.78As already noted, the two great virtues of the surface code are t hat
error syndromes can be extracted using only geometrically local pr ocessing in a
two-dimensional layout, and that each syndrome bit can be read ou t using a simple
quantum circuit involving only four data qubits. As a result, the surf ace code can
tolerate higher error rates than other feasible quantum codes.79–81
Despite being more eﬀective than other codes, error correction w ith the surface
code still carries a rather hefty overhead cost in the number of qu bits and gates
needed. Let’s suppose we can do physical controlled-NOT gates wit h an error
rate of .1%. That’s better than we have now in multiqubit devices, but might
aThis discussion reﬂects progress that had already been repo rted at the time of the Solvay Con-
ference in May 2022.

plausibly be reached in the near future. Perhaps we will start to see quantum
advantage using circuits with hundreds of protected qubits and millio ns of high-
ﬁdelity quantum (Toﬀoli) gates. To execute those circuits, we’re like ly to need at
least tens of thousands of physical qubits. For breaking public key cryptosystems
using Shor’s algorithm, it is estimated that 20 million physical qubits are needed.125
If we can somehowdo controlled-NOTgates with four 9s ofﬁdelity, a n improvement
by another order of magnitude, that will reduce the overhead cos t, but we’re still
likely to want at least hundreds of physical qubits per logical qubit to see signiﬁcant
quantum advantage running algorithms we currently know about. T hese numbers
are surely daunting from the perspective of currently available tec hnology.
In an exciting recent development, quantum codes have been disco veredthat are
far more eﬃcient than the surface code.2,126,127Someday we might use these codes
to reduce signiﬁcantly the overhead cost of fault-tolerant quant um computing. As
best we currently understand, though, to perform well these co des require much
lower physical error rates than the surface code, and so are not likely to be useful
until much better quantum hardware is available.
Much better gate error rates?
It would pay oﬀ handsomely to have much improved physical gate err or rates in
quantum hardware, but that’s very hard to achieve. A particularly visionary pro-
posal is topological quantum computing, where qubits are encoded in an exotic ma-
terial that provides physical protection against noise.128High ﬁdelity topologically
protected quantum gates, if realized, would be a genuine milestone f or quantum
many-body physics, aside from any implications for future informat ion technolo-
gies. Though the theoretical idea is compelling, up to now experiment al progress
has been slow.129
Thereareotherpotentialwaystoincorporatebetterprotectio nagainstnoiseinto
the hardware itself. Some promising ideas exploit precise manipulation of bosonic
modes, such as microwave resonators in superconducting circuits , harmonic motion
of trapped ions, or optical modes in photonic devices. For example, GKP-encoded
states ofbosonicmodes havea periodic gridstructurein phase spa ce, allowingslight
shifts in phase space to be corrected.130–132Bosonic cat codes use superpositions
of coherent states to provide strong protection against bit ﬂips, resulting in highly
biased physicalnoise that can be correctedby quantum codes at a reduced overhead
cost.133–135Fluxonium qubits136,137and zero-pi qubits138,139use strong nonlinear-
ity resulting from large inductance in a superconducting circuit to su ppress noise.
In the arena of superconducting qubits, all of these schemes are more complex than
the relatively simple transmon; they are still at a comparatively early stage, and we
can’t say yet how they’ll pan out. But it is important to continue purs uing these
and other challenging approaches oﬀering the potential for a leap f orward in per-
formance, because signiﬁcantly lower physical gate error rates w ill bring us closer
to useful applications of quantum computation.

Creating quantum states of matter
The quantum technology we already have is exciting, as it provides ne w tools for
exploring the physics of many entangled particles. On this front, to o, we’ve seen
signiﬁcant recent progress, including unprecedented studies of n ew quantum phases
of matter. I’ll highlight two examples.
The Harvard/MIT group, using a Rydberg atom platform with 219 qu bits, re-
cently created and detected a novel highly entangled phase of qua ntum matter, a
quantum spin liquid.140Theorists have speculated about quantum spin liquids for
nearly 50 years,141but convincing experimental evidence for this type of quantum
state had never been seen before, for two main reasons. First, o ne needs a material
with suitable properties for qubits to seek a ground state with long- range quantum
entanglement. In nature, such materials seem to be rare. Second , the features of
a long-range-entangled state are very elusive to observe becaus e one needs to make
collective observations on many qubits at once. The Rydberg platfo rm is highly
programmable and suﬃciently versatile to simulate the right kind of ma terial. And
one can measure nonlocal observables with suﬃcient ﬁdelity to ident ify signatures
of long-range entanglement.
Guided by university condensed matter physicists from Stanford, Princeton,
the Max Planck Institute and elsewhere, 20 superconducting qubit s in the Google
Sycamore processor were used to create and observe a discrete time crystal.142
This is a novel phase of matter in a periodically driven system, which os cillates
indeﬁnitely at a frequency diﬀerent from that of the periodic drive. The idea of
a time crystal had been suggested for the ﬁrst time 10 years ago,143and there
had been previous experiments which were partially successful in va lidating the
phenomenon,144–146but the high ﬁdelity gates and accurate single-qubit readout
and control in Sycamore made a more convincing demonstration pos sible.
Take note of two things. First, ﬁve years ago Rydberg atoms were not so much
on the radar screen of quantum platforms, yet now they are adva ncing rapidly.
That reminds us that we are still in the early days of quantum techno logy, and
big surprises may continue to arise. Second, the Google experiment was done on a
gate-based quantum computer, while the Harvard/MIT experimen t was done in a
programmableanalogmode. Thatremindsusthatthesetwoapproa chestostudying
quantum matter are complementary, and both are valuable to purs ue.
These are encouraging signs that we’re acquiring tools to create an d investigate
a variety of other new quantum phases of matter in the near futur e, both in equi-
librium like a quantum spin liquid, or driven far from equilibrium like a discret e
time crystal. There are good reasons to be impressed by these dev elopments. First
because, of the applications of quantum computing that we curren tly foresee, those
to materials and chemistry are the ones that seem to have the grea test potential to
beneﬁt humanity broadly speaking, and it’s exciting that we already h ave tools in
the currenterathatcanadvanceourunderstandingofquantum matter. And second
because studies of topological phases could ignite new approaches to quantum error

13
correction and fault tolerance that will pay oﬀ in the longer run. Loo king ahead,
we can glimpse opportunities to create states of matter beyond wh at is known to
occur in nature, which can have both scientiﬁc and technological va lue.
Opportunities in quantum simulation
What will be the long term impact of quantum computing on society? No one
knows that. Nor should we be expected to envision clearly how quant um computing
might change the world. As I’ve said, of the applications we currently most clearly
foresee, what we imagine is most likely to broadly beneﬁt humanity are applications
to chemistry and materials, which could improve human health, energ y production,
agriculture, and the sustainability of our planet.
Can we be more concrete about that expected impact? That’s quite diﬃcult
for several reasons. We seek applications of quantum computing t hat meet three
criteria. The problems of interest should be too hard to solve with co nventional
computing, eﬃciently solvable by quantum computers, and the solut ions should be
of scientiﬁc and/or practical value.
There are methods for simulating complex molecules and highly correla ted ma-
terials using conventional computers which are actually rather goo d, and getting
better fast, not just because conventional computers are bec oming more powerful,
but even more importantly because the classical algorithms are get ting better.5For
computing properties of ground states and other low-energy sta tes, the classical
methods are heuristic, without rigorous performance guarantee s. But numerical
evidence suggests that the resources needed to obtain accurat e results using clas-
sical methods such as those based on tensor networks and neura l networks scale
reasonably with system size for typical molecules or materials that a re of scientiﬁc
interest, because these systems are not so profoundly entangle d. If that’s true, the
advantage enjoyed by quantum computers may scale polynomially ra ther that ex-
ponentially for such problems.147And the competing quantum methods are also
heuristic, because to obtain accurate results eﬃciently we must be able to prepare
states in the quantum computer that have a substantial overlap w ith the targeted
quantum states, which is not rigorously guaranteed. The general purpose method
for performing the state preparation task is the adiabatic method , which can be
very expensive in systems where there are multiple competing phase s separated by
ﬁrst-order phase transitions, as is often true in cases of interes t.
Exponential quantum advantage can be expected in quantum simula tion of dy-
namics, if we consider easily prepared initial excited states which bec ome highly
entangled as they evolve, for example in highly inelastic collisions of fun damental
particles in a quantum ﬁeld theory.148What scientiﬁc opportunities that may entail
is an issue worthy of further investigation.

Challenges in quantum gravity
Circling back to quantum gravity, what are some of the challenges wh ere we can
realistically expect to make substantial progress in the reasonably near future?
In the case ofquantum gravityin anti-de Sitter space, we still lack a goodhandle
on why local quantum physics provides an excellent approximation on distance
scales that are small compared to the scale of the spatial curvatu re. In addition, the
spacetime we live in is not anti-de Sitter, and we need better tools for describing
quantum gravity in spacetimes that are asymptotically ﬂat or positiv ely curved.
Anti-de Sitter space has the convenient feature that spacetime h as a boundary, and
we can deﬁne the observables of the theory by making reference t o that boundary.
But de Sitter space, which is relevant to early-universe inﬂationary cosmology, does
not have that convenient feature, which makes quantum gravity in de Sitter space
intrinsically harder to think about.
Despite remarkable recent progress,7,8we don’t have an adequate way, in quan-
tumgravity,todescribetheexperienceofanobserverwhofallsint oablackhole, and
we especially don’t know what happens to observers who encounter the singularity
in the black hole interior.
Holographic duality is very empowering, but we have analytic control over how
it works only in a limited number of special cases. Can we understand m ore sys-
tematically under what conditions a nongravitational boundary the ory admits a
holographic dual which is useful for describing quantum gravitation al phenomena?
Andcanwelearnmoreconcretelywhatresourceswe’llneedtosimula tequantum
gravity with quantum computers, and compute observable proper ties of scientiﬁc
interest?
Quantum gravity: can experiments help?
Eventually, we might hope to make progress on some of these quest ions by using
quantum computers and quantum simulators; in particular, by simula ting strongly-
coupled quantum many-body systems and leveraging holographic du ality, we might
probe the dual quantum geometry by measuring features of quan tum entanglement
on the boundary. We might, for example, learn about locality in the bu lk spacetime
thoughlinearresponsemeasurementsthatyieldinformationabout thecommutators
of boundary observables. Studying the entanglement dynamics of strongly chaotic
systems can reveal how quantum information gets scrambled, whic h might unveil
signatures of string theory in the bulk. Or we might in other context s be able
to measure quantum corrections to semiclassical gravity that wou ld be hard to
compute analytically or by using classical computers. Simulations of v ery-high-
energy scattering in the bulk could be especially instructive.
Perhaps guidance from simulations can help us to grasp holographic d ual de-
scriptions of spacetimes beyond anti-de Sitter space. And we may ﬁ nd that some
otherwise opaque features of strongly-coupled dynamics can be m ore easily inter-
preted using the lens of bulk quantum gravity. One already much stu died example
August 18, 2022 0:9 ws-procs961x669 WSPC Proceedings - 9.61 in x 6.69in Preskill˙Solvay28˙Overview page 15
15
is a mysterious type of coherent quantum teleportation in the boun dary theory
which has a quite natural alternative interpretation in terms of qua ntum informa-
tion transmitted through a traversable spatial wormhole in the bulk theory.149–152
4. Some things I haven’t mentioned
There are some important things I have not yet had time to mention in this talk,
of which I list four here.
The discovery of Shor’s algorithm will have a disruptive eﬀect on elect ronic
commerce, as the public key cryptosystems we now rely on to prote ct our privacy
will no longer be secure when powerful quantum computers are rea dily available.
The world is responding by developing new classical cryptosystems t hat are widely
believed to be resistant to attack by quantum computers.153It will be a necessary
task, but a prolonged and expensive one, to deploy these new syst ems.
An alternative approach to protecting our privacy is to distribute s ecure private
keys through quantum communication, presumably by sending phot ons through
optical ﬁber or free space.24,25Here the security rests on principles of quantum
physics, rather than assumptions about the computational powe r of our adver-
saries, and in fact there are protocols which are provably secure e ven if we don’t
trust the equipment we use to distribute the key.154It’s not clearto what extent the
world will demand quantum cryptography for secure communication ; in any event,
quantum key distribution on a global scale will require new technologie s which are
now nascent, like quantum repeaters to extend the range of quan tum communica-
tion, which in turn are likely to rely on transduction of single-photon s ignals from
optical to microwave frequencies and back.155As is the case for quantum comput-
ing, we still lack a clear understanding of what will be the most impactf ul future
applications of quantum networking.
Advancing quantum technology will also enhance the sensitivity and r esolution
of sensors, which can be expected to have widespread applications including in-
ertial sensors for navigation, gravity gradiometers for surveyin g, magnetometers
for noninvasive nanoscale imaging of living mater, and many others.156There are
also applications of fundamental interest, including looking for symm etry viola-
tions in searches for new physics, dark matter detection, detect ion of gravitational
waves with enhanced sensitivity, and long-baseline optical interfer ometry enabled
by quantum teleportation within a network of telescopes. These imp rovements will
be based on advanced quantum strategies, which exploit squeezing , entanglement,
and quantum error correction.
Another important issue is: how can we be sure that a quantum comp utation
gives the right answer? In some cases, like when factoring a large nu mber, the
answer once found can be easily checked with a classical computer, but that’s not
the case if, for example, we are simulating the properties of a comple x quantum
many-body system. Yet clever protocols have been developed for verifying that a
quantum computer really performs an assigned task; these levera ge the power of

16
quantum-resistant cryptography.157One important challenge is to reduce the cost
of these veriﬁcation protocols so we can make use of them in the rela tively near
term, if for example we send a job to a quantum server in the cloud, a nd want to
be conﬁdent that the answer we receive can be trusted.
5. Conclusions
To conclude, we might have a long road ahead to practical commercia l applica-
tions of quantum computing, and quantum error correction is most likely the key
to getting there eventually. But the next ﬁve years should be excit ing, marked by
progress toward fault-tolerant quantum computing and unprece dented opportuni-
ties to explore exotic properties of quantum matter.
Asthis conferencehasillustrated, ThePhysicsofQuantumInform ationprovides
unifying concepts and powerful technologies for controlling and ex ploring complex
many-particle quantum systems of both practical and fundament al interest. Com-
munication among the practitioners of quantum computer science, quantum hard-
ware, quantum matter, and quantum gravity sparks new ideas and insights, making
life sweeter for all of us who investigate the elusive properties of hig hly entangled
quantum systems.
For the longer term quantum science and technology face enormou s challenges,
and many advances in both basic research and systems engineering will be needed
to fulﬁll our aspirations. We’ve only just begun.

1.Introduction
In 1987 a Geometry and Topology year was organized by Prof. Ch ern
in Nankai and I participated as an undergraduate from the Uni versity of
Science and Technology of China. There I learned about M. Fre edman’s
work on 4-dimensional manifolds. Then I went to the Universi ty of Califor-
nia at San Diego to study with M. Freedman in 1989, and later be came his
most frequent collaborator. It is a great pleasure to contri bute an article
to the memory of Prof. Chern based partially on some joint wor ks with M.
Freedman and others. Most of the materials are known to exper ts except
some results about the classiﬁcation of topological quantu m ﬁeld theories
(TQFTs) in the end. This paper is written during a short time, so inaccu-
racies are unavoidable. Comments and questions are welcome .
TherearenobetterplacesformetostartthantheChern-Simo ntheory. In
the hands of Witten, the Chern-Simons functional is used to d eﬁne TQFTs
which explain the evaluations of the Jones polynomial of lin ks at certain
roots of unity. It takes great imagination to relate the Cher n-Simons theory
to electrons in magnetic ﬁelds, and quantum computing. Neve rtheless, such
a nexus does exist and I will outline this picture. No attempt has been made
regarding references and completeness.
2.Chern-Simons theory and TQFTs
Fix a simply connected Lie group G. Given a closed oriented 3-manifold
Mand a connection Aon a principle G-bundlePoverM, the Chern-Simons
3-form tr( A∧dA+2
3A3) is discovered when Profs. Chern and Simons tried
to derive a purely combinatorial formula for the ﬁrst Pontrj agin number of
a 4-manifold. Let CS(A) =1
8π2/integraltext
Mtr(A∧dA+2
3A3) be the Chern-Simons
functional. To get a TQFT, we need to deﬁne a complex number fo r each
closed oriented 3-manifold Mwhich is a topological invariant, and a vector
spaceV(Σ) for each closed oriented 2-dimensional surface Σ. For a l evel
k≥h∨+ 1, where h∨is the dual Coxeter number of G, the 3-manifold
invariant of Mis the path integral Zk(M3) =/integraltext

DAhas yet to be deﬁned rigorously. A closely related 3-manifol d invariant
is discovered rigorously by N. Reshetikhin and V. Turaev bas ed on quan-
tum groups. To deﬁne a vector space for a closed oriented surf ace Σ, let
Xbe an oriented 3-manifold whose boundary is Σ. Consider a pri nciple
G-bundlePoverX, ﬁx a connection aon the restriction of Pto Σ, let
Zk,a=/integraltext
(A,a)e2πi·k·CS(A)DA, where the integral is over all gauge-classes of
connections of AonPoverXwhose restriction to Σ is a. This deﬁnes a
functional on all connections {a}on the principle G-bundlePover Σ. By
forming formal ﬁnite sums, we obtain an inﬁnite dimensional vector space
S(Σ). In particular, a 3-manifold Xsuch that ∂X= Σ deﬁnes a vector in
S(Σ). Path integral on disks introduces relations onto the fu nctionals, we
get a ﬁnitely dimensional quotient of S(Σ), which is the desired vector space
V(Σ). Again such ﬁnitely dimensional vector spaces are const ructed math-
ematically by N. Reshetikhin and V. Turaev. The 3-manifold i nvariant of
closed oriented 3-manifolds and the vectors spaces associa ted to the closed
orientedsurfacesformpartoftheWitten-Reshetikhin-Tur aev-Chern-Simons
TQFT based on Gat level= k. Strictly speaking the 3-manifold invariant
is deﬁned only for framed 3-manifolds. This subtlety will be ignored in the
following.
Given a TQFT and a closed oriented surface Σ with two connecte d com-
ponentsΣ1,Σ2, whereΣ1is Σ1with the opposite orientation, a 3-manifold
Xwith boundary ∂X= Σ gives rise to a linear map from V(Σ1) toV(Σ2).
Then the mapping cylinder construction for self-diﬀeomorph isms of surfaces
leads to a projective representation of the mapping class gr oups of surfaces.
This is the TQFT as axiomatized by M. Atiyah. Later G. Moore an d N.
Seiberg, K. Walker and others extended TQFTs to surfaces wit h bound-
aries. The new ingredient is the introduction of labels for t he boundaries
of surfaces. For the Chern-Simons TQFTs, the labels are the i rreducible
representations of the quantum deformation groups of Gat level= kor the
positive energy representations of the loop groups of Gat level= k. For more
details and references, see [T].
3.Electrons in a flatland
Eighteen years beforethediscovery of electron, agraduate studentE. Hall
was studying Electricity and Magnetism using a book of Maxwe ll. He was
puzzled by a paragraph in Maxwell’s book and performed an exp eriment to
test the statement. He disproved the statement by discoveri ng the so-called
Hall eﬀect. In 1980, K. von Klitzing discovered the integer qu antum Hall
eﬀect (IQHE) which won him the 1985 Nobel Prize. Two years late r, H.
Stormer, D. Tsui and A. Gossard discovered the fractional qu antum Hall
eﬀect (FQHE) which led to the 1998 Nobel Prize for H. Stormer, D . Tsui
and R. Laughlin. They were all studying electrons in a 2-dime nsional plane
immersed in a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld. Laughlin’s pred iction of the
fractional charge of quasi-particles in FQHE electron liqu ids is conﬁrmed
TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM COMPUTING 3
by experiments. Such quasi-particles are anyons, a term int roduced by F.
Wilczek. Braid statistics of anyons are deduced, and experi ments to conﬁrm
braid statistics are being pursued.
The quantum mechanical problem of an electron in a magnetic ﬁ eld was
solved by L. Landau. But there are about 1011electrons per cm2for FQHE
liquids, which render the solution of the realistic Hamilto nian for such elec-
tron systems impossible, even numerically. The approach in condensed mat-
ter physics is to write down an eﬀective theory which describe s the universal
properties of the electron systems. The electrons are stron gly interacting
with each other to form an incompressible electron liquid wh en the FQHE
could beobserved. Landau’s solution for a single electron i n a magnetic ﬁeld
shows that quantum mechanically an electron behaves like a h armonic os-
cillator. Therefore its energy is quantized to Landau level s. For a ﬁnite size
sample of a 2-dimensional electron system in a magnetic ﬁeld , the number
of electrons in the sample divided by the number of ﬂux quanta in the per-
pendicular magnetic ﬁeld is called the Landau ﬁlling fracti onν. The state
of an electron system depends strongly on the Landau ﬁlling f raction. For
ν <1/5, the electron system is a Wigner crystal: the electrons are pinned at
the vertices of a triangular lattice. For νis an integer, the electron system
is an IQHE liquid, where the interaction among electrons can be neglected.
Whenνare certain fractions such as 1 /3,1/5,..., the electrons are in a
FQHE state. Both IQHE and FQHE are characterized by the quant ization
of the Hall resistance Rxy=ν−1h
e2, whereeis the electron charge and hthe
Planck constant, and the exponentially vanishing of the lon gitudinal resis-
tanceRxx. There are about 50 such fractions and the quantization of Rxy
is reproducible up to 10−10. How could an electron system with so many
uncontrolled factors such as thedisorders, sample shapesa nd strength of the
magnetic ﬁelds, quantize soprecisely? TheIQHEhas asatisf actory explana-
tion both physically and mathematically. The mathematical explanation is
based on non-commutative Chern classes. For the FQHE at ﬁlli ng fractions
with odd denominators, the composite fermion theory based o n U(1)-Chern-
Simons theory is a great success: electrons combined with vo rtices to form
composite fermions and then composite fermions, as new part icles, to form
their own integer quantum Hall liquids. Theexceptional cas e is theobserved
FQHEν= 5/2. There are still very interesting questions about this FQH
state. For more details and references see [G].
4.Topologization of electron liquids
The discovery of the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect has cast so me doubts
on Landau theory for states of matter. A new concept, topolog ical order, is
proposed by Xiao-gang Wen of MIT. It is believed that the elec tron liquid
in a FQHE state is in a topological state with a Chern-Simons T QFT as
an eﬀective theory. In general topological states of matter h ave TQFTs as
eﬀective theories. The ν= 5/2 FQH electron liquid is still a puzzle. The
4 ZHENGHAN WANG
leading theory is based on the Pfaﬃan states proposed by G. Mo ore and
N. Read in 1991 [MR]. In this theory, the quarsi-particles ar e non-abelian
anyons (a.k.a. plectons) and the non-abelian statistics is described by the
Chern-Simons-SU(2) TQFT at level=2.
To describe the new states of matter such as the FQH electron l iquids, we
need new concepts and methods. Consider the following Gedan ken experi-
ment: suppose an electron liquid is conﬁned to a closed orien ted surface Σ,
for example a torus. The lowest energy states of the system fo rm a Hilbert
spaceV(Σ), called the ground states manifold. In an ordinary quant um
system, the ground state will be unique, so V(Σ) is 1-dimensional. But for
topological states of matter, the ground states manifold is often degenerate
(more than 1-dimensional), i.e. there are several orthogon al ground states
with exponentially small energy diﬀerences. This ground sta tes degeneracy
is a new quantum number. Hence a topological quantum system a ssigns
each closed oriented surface Σ a Hilbert space V(Σ), which is exactly the
rule for a TQFT. FQH electron liquid always has an energy gap i n the ther-
modynamic limit which is equivalent to the incompressibili ty of the electron
liquid. Therefore the ground states manifold is stable if co ntrolled below the
gap. Since the ground states manifold has the same energy, th e Hamilton-
ian of the system restricted to the ground states manifold is 0, hence there
will be no continuous evolutions. This agrees with the direc t Lengendre
transform form the Chern-Simons Lagrangians to Hamiltonin ans. Since the
Chern-Simons 3-form has only ﬁrst derivatives, the corresp onding Hamil-
tonian is identically 0. In summary, ground states degenera cy, energy gap
and the vanishing of the Hamiltonian are all salient feature s of topological
quantum systems.
Although the Hamiltonian for a topological system is identi cally 0, there
are still discrete dynamics induced by topological changes . In this case the
Schrodinger equation is analogous to the situation for a fun ctionf(x) such
thatf′(x) = 0, butthereareinteresting solutionsifthedomainof f(x)isnot
connected as then f(x) can have diﬀerent constants on the connected com-
ponents. This is exactly why braid group representations ar ise as dynamics
of topological quantum systems.
5.Anyons and braid group representations
Elementary excitations of FQH liquids are quasi-particles . In the follow-
ing we will not distinguish quasi-particles from particles . Actually it is not
inconceivable that particles are just quasi-particles fro m some complicated
vacuum systems. Particle types serve as the labels for TQFTs . Suppose a
topological quantum system conﬁned on a surface Σ has elemen tary exci-
tations localized at certain points p1,p2,···on Σ, the ground states of the
system outside some small neighborhoods of piform a Hilbert space. This
Hilbert space is associated to the surface with the small nei ghborhoods of
TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM COMPUTING 5
pideleted and each resulting boundary circle is labelled by th e correspond-
ing particle type. Although there are no continuous evoluti ons, there are
discrete evolutions of the ground states induced by topolog ical changes such
as the mapping class groups of Σ which preserve the boundarie s and their
labels. An interesting case is the mapping class groups of th e disk with n
punctures—the famous braid groups on n-strands, Bn.
Another way to describe the braid groups Bnis as follows: given a col-
lection of nparticles in the plane R2, and let I= [t0,t1] be a time interval.
Then the trajectories of the particles will be ndisjoint curves in R2×Iif
at any moment the nparticles are kept apart from each other. If the n
particles at time t1return to their initial positions at time t0as a set, then
their trajectories form an n-braidσ. Braids can be stacked on top of each
other to form the braid groups Bn. Suppose the particles can be braided
adiabatically so that the quantum system would be always in t he ground
states, then we have a unitary transformation from the groun d states at
timet0to the ground states at time t1. LetV(Σ) be the Hilbert space for
the ground states manifold, then a braid induces a unitary tr ansformation
onV(Σ). Actually those unitary transformations give rise to a p rojective
representation of the braid groups. If the nparticles are of the same type,
the resulting representations of the braid groups will be ca lled the braid
statistics. Note that there is a group homomorphism from the braid group
Bnto the permutation groups Snby remembering only the initial and ﬁnal
positions of the nparticles.
The plane R2above can be replaced by any space Xand statistics can be
deﬁned for particles in Xsimilarly. The braid groups are replaced by the
fundamental groups Bn(X) of the conﬁguration spaces Cn(X). IfX=Rm
for some m >2, it is well known that Bn(X) isSn. Therefore, all par-
ticle statistics will be given by representations of the per mutation groups.
There are two irreducible 1-dimensional representations o fSn, which corre-
spond to bosons and fermions. If the statistics does not fact orize through
the permutation groups Sn, the particles are called anyons. If the images
are inU(1), the anyon will be called abelian, and otherwise non-abe lian.
The quasi-particles in the FQH liquid at ν= 1/3 are abelian anyons. To
be directly useful for topological quantum computing, we ne ed non-abelian
anyons. Do non-abelian anyons exist?
Mathematically are there unitary representations of the br aid groups?
There are many representations of the braid groups, but unit ary ones are
not easy to ﬁnd. The most famous representations of the braid groups are
probably the Burau representation discovered in 1936, whic h can be used
to deﬁne the Alexander polynomial of links, and the Jones rep resentation
discovered in 1981, which led to the Jones polynomial of link s. It is only in
1984 that the Burau representation was observed to beunitar y by C. Squier,
and the Jones representation is unitary as it was discovered in a unitary
world [J1]. So potentially there could be non-abelian anyon statistics. An
interesting question is: given a family of unitary represen tations of the braid
6 ZHENGHAN WANG
groupsρn:Bn→U(kn), when this family of representations can be used to
simulatethestandardquantumcircuit modeleﬃciently andf aulttolerantly?
A suﬃcient condition is that they come from a certain TQFT, bu t is it
necessary?
Are there non-abelian anyons in Nature? This is an important unknown
questionat thewriting. Experimentsareunderwaytoconﬁrm theprediction
of the existence in certain FQH liquids [DFN]. Speciﬁcally t he FQH liquid at
ν= 5/2 is believed to have non-abelian anyons whose statistics is described
by the Jones representation at the 4-th root of unity. More ge nerally N.
Read and E. Rezayi conjectured that the Jones representatio n of the braid
groups at r-th root of unity describes the non-abelian stati stics for FQH
liquids at ﬁlling fractions ν= 2+k
k+2, wherek=r−2 is the level [RR]. For
more details and references on anyons see [Wi].
As an anecdote, a few years ago I wrote an article with others a bout
quantum computing using non-abelian anyons and submitted i t to the jour-
nal Nature. The paper was rejected within almost a week with a statement
that the editors did not believe in the existence of non-abel ian anyons. For-
tunately the ﬁnal answer has to come from Mother Nature, rath er than the
journal Nature.
6.Topological quantum computing
In 1980s Yu. Manin and R. Feynman articulated the possibilit y of com-
puting machines based on quantum physics to compute much fas ter than
classical computers. Shor’s factoring algorithm in 1994 ha s dramatically
changed the ﬁeld and stirred great interests in building qua ntum comput-
ers. There are no theoretical obstacles for building quantu m computers as
the accuracy threshold theorem has shown. But decoherence a nd errors in
implementing unitary gates have kept most experiments to ju st a few qubits.
In1997 M. Freedman proposedthepossibility ofTQFTcomputi ng[F]. Inde-
pendently A. Kitaev proposed the idea of fault tolerant quan tum computing
using anyons [K]. The two ideas are essentially equivalent a s we have al-
luded before. Leaving aside the issue of discovering non-ab elian anyons, we
may ask how to compute using non-abelian anyons? For more det ails and
references see [NC].
6.1.Jones representation of the braid groups. Jones representation
of the braid groups is the same as the Witten-Reshetikhin-Tu raev-SU(2)
TQFT representation of the braid groups. Closely related th eories can be
deﬁned via the Kaﬀuman bracket. For an even level k, the two theories are
essentially the same, but for odd levels the two theories are distinguished
by the Frobenius-Schur indicators. However the resulting b raid group rep-
resentations are the same. Therefore we will describe the br aid group repre-
sentations using the Kauﬀman bracket. The Kauﬀman bracket is a n algebra
homomorphism from the group algebras of the braid groups C[Bn] to the
generic Temperley-Lieb algebras. For applications to quan tum computing
TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM COMPUTING 7
we need unitary theories. So we specialize the Kauﬀman variab leAto
certain roots of unity. The resulting algebras are reducibl e. Semi-simple
quotients can be obtained by imposing the Jones-Wenzl idemp otents. The
semi-simple quotient algebras will be called the Jones alge bras, which are
direct sum of matrix algebras. Fix rand anAsatisfying A4=e±2πi/r,
the Jones representation for a braid σis the Kauﬀman bracket image in
the Jones algebra. To describe the Jones representation, we need to ﬁnd
the decomposition of the Jones algebras into their simple ma trix compo-
nents (irreducible sectors). The set of particle types for t he Chern-Simons-
SU(2) TQFT at level= kisL={0,1,···,k}. The fusion rules are given by
a⊗b=⊕c, wherea,b,csatisfy
1). the sum a+b+cis even,
2).a+b≥c,b+c≥a,c+a≥b,
3).a+b+c≤2k.
A triple ( a,b,c),a,b,c∈Lsatisfying the above three conditions will be
called admissible.
The Jones algebra at level= kfor n-strands decomposes into irreducible
sectors labeled by an integer msuch that m∈L,m=n mod2. Fixm, the
irreducible sector has a deﬁning representation Vm
1nwith a basis consisting
of admissible labelings of the following tree (Fig. 1):
0 m1               1 1            1
.  .   .  .  .  .
Figure 1. Basis
There are nvertical edges labeled by 1, and the 0-th horizontal edge
(leftmost) is always labeled by 0, and the n-th edge (rightmo st) is always
labeled by m. The internal ( n−1) edges are labeled by a,b,c,···such
that any three labels incident to a trivalent vertex form an a dmissible triple.
A basis with internal labelings a,b,c,···will be denoted by em
a,b,c,···. The
Kauﬀman bracket is σi=A·id+A−1·Ui, so it suﬃces to describe the matrix
forUiwith basis em
a,b,c,···inVm
1n. The matrix for Uiconsists of 1 ×1 and 2×2
blocks. Fix mand a basis element em
a,b,c,···, suppose that the i,i+ 1,i+ 2
internal edges are labeled by f,g,h. Iff/ne}ationslash=h, thenUimaps this basis to 0.
Iff=h, then by the fusions rules g=f±1 (the special case is f= 0, then
g= 1 only), then Uimapsem

From those formulas, there is a choice of x,yup to a scalar, and in order
to get a unitary representation, we need to choose Aso that the 2 ×2 blocks
are real symmetric matrices. This forces Ato satisfy q=A4=e±2πi/r. It
also follows that the eigenvalues of σiare−1,qup to scalars.
6.2.Anyonic quantum computers. We will use the level=2 theory to
illustrate the construction of topological quantum comput ers. There are
three particle types {0,1,2}. The label 0 denotes the null-particle type,
which is the vacuum state. Particles of type 1 are believed to be non-abelian
anyons. Consider the unitary Jones representation of B4, the irreducible
sector with m= 0 has a basis {e0
1,b,1}, whereb= 0 or 2. Hence this can be
usedtoencodeaqubit. For B6, abasisconsistsof e0
1,b1,1,b2,1, wherebi,i= 1,2
is 0 or 2. Hence this can be used to encode 2-qubits. In general n-qubits can
beencodedby the m= 0 irreduciblesector of theJones representation ρ0
2n+2
ofB2n+2. The unitary matrices of the Jones representations ρ0
4(B4),ρ0
4(B6)
will be quantum gates. To simulate a quantum circuit on n-qub itsUL:
(C2)⊗n→(C2)⊗n, we need a braid σ∈B2n+2such that the following
diagram commutes:
(C)2⊗n∼=/d47/d47

/d15/d15V0
12n+2
ρ0
2n+2(σ)
/d15/d15
(C)2⊗n
∼=/d47/d47V0
12n+2
This is not always possiblebecause the images of the Jones re presentation
of the braid groups at r= 4 are ﬁnite groups. It follows that the topological
model at r= 4 is not universal. To get a universal computer, we consider
other levels of the Chern-Simons-SU(2) TQFT. The resulting model for r=
4 is slightly diﬀerent from the above one. To simulate n-qubit s, we consider
the braid group B4n. The 4n edges besides the leftmost in Fig. 1 can be
dividedinto ngroupsof 4. Considerthebasis elements such e very 4k-th edge
is labelled by 0, and every (4k+2)-th edge can be labeled eith er by 0 or 2.
Those2nbasiselements willbeusedtoencoden-qubits. Therepresen tations
of the braid groups B4nwill be used to simulate any quantum circuits on
n-qubits. This is possible for any level other than 1,2 and 4 [ FLW1][FLW2].
6.3.Measurement in topological models. A pictorial illustration of a
topological quantum computer is as follows (Fig. 2):
We start the computation with the ground states of a topologi cal system,
then create particle pairs from the ground states to encode t he initial state
which is denoted by |cup >(two bottom cup). A braid bis adiabatically
performed to induce the desired unitary matrix ρ(b). In the end, we anni-
hilate the two leftmost quasi-particles (the top cap) and re cord the particle
TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM COMPUTING 9

types of the fusion. Then we repeat the process polynomially many times
to get an approximation of the probability of observing any p article type.
Actually we need only to distinguish the trivial versus all o ther non-trivial
particle types. For level=3 or r= 5, the probability to observe the trivial
particle type 0 is < cap|ρ+(b)/producttext
0ρ(b)|cup >, which is related to the Jones
polynomial of the following circuit link (Fig. 3) by the form ula:
p= prob(0) =1

minima (L)
Figure 3. Circuit link
where in the formula c=c(L) is the number of components of the link L,
[2] =−A2−A−2is quantum 2 ar r= 5. Our normalization for the Jones
polynomial is that for the unlink with c components, the Jone s polynomial
is (−[2])c.
To derive this formula, we assume the writhe of L is 0. Other ca ses are
similar. In the Kauﬀman bracket formulation, the projector t o null particle
type/producttext
0is the same as the elementU1
−[2]of the Jones algebras. It follows
thatpis just the Kauﬀman bracket of the tangle b·U1·b−1divided by −[2].
10 ZHENGHAN WANG
Now consider the Kaﬀman bracket < L >ofL, resolving the 4 crossings
ofLon the component γusing the Kauﬀman bracket results a sum of 16
terms. Simplifying, we get
< L >= (−[2])c([2]2−3)+(4−[2]2)(−[2])c·p.
Since the writhe is assumed to be 0, the Kauﬀman bracket is the s ame as
the Jones polynomial of L. Solving for p, we obtain
p=3−[2]2
4−[2]2(1+(−1)c·VL(e2πi/5)
[2]c·(3−[2]2).
Direct calculation using the identity [2]2= 1+ [2] gives the desired for-
mula. This formula shows that if non-abelian anyons exist to realize the
Jones representation of the braid groups, then quantum comp uters will ap-
proximate the Jones polynomial of certain links. So the Jone s polynomial of
links are amplitudes for certain quantum processes [FKLW]. This inspired
a deﬁnition of a new approximation scheme: the additive appr oximation
which might lead to a new characterization of the computatio nal class BQP
[BFLW].
6.4.Universality of topological models. In order to simulate all quan-
tum circuits, it suﬃces to have the closed images of the braid groups rep-
resentations containing the special unitary groups for eac h representation
space. In 1981 when Jones discovered his revolutionary unit ary representa-
tion of the braid groups, he proved that the images of the irre ducible sectors
of his unitary representation are ﬁnite if r= 1,2,3,4,6 for all nandr= 10
forn= 3. For all other cases the closed images are inﬁnite modulo c enter.
He asked what are the closed images? In the joint work with M. F reedman,
and M. Larsen [FLW2], we proved that they are as large as they c an be:
always contain the special unitary groups. As a corollary, w e have proved
the universality of the anyonic quantum computers for r/ne}ationslash= 1,2,3,4,6.
The proof is interesting in its own right as we formulated a tw o-eigenvalue
problem and found its solution [FLW2]. The question of under standing
TQFT representations of the mapping class groups are widely open. Partial
results are obtained in [LW].
6.5.Simulation of TQFTs. In another joint work with M. Freedman,
and A. Kitaev [FKW], we proved that any unitary TQFT can be eﬃc iently
simulated by a quantum computer. Combined with the universa lity for
certain TQFTs, we established the equivalence of TQFT compu ting with
quantum computing. As corollaries of the simulation theore m, we obtained
quantumalgorithmsforapproximatingquantuminvariantss uchastheJones
polynomial. Jones polynomial is a specialization of the Tut te polynomial of
graphs. It is interesting to ask if there are other partition functions that can
be approximated by quantum computers eﬃciently [Wel].
TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM COMPUTING 11
6.6.Fault tolerance of topological models. Anyonic quantum comput-
ers are inherently fault tolerant [K]. This is essentially a consequence of
the disk axiom of TQFTs if the TQFTs can be localized to lattic es on sur-
faces. Localization of TQFTs can also be used to establish an energy gap
rigorously.
7.Classification of topological states of matter
Topological orders of FQH electron liquids are modelled by T QFTs. It is
an interesting and diﬃcult problem to classify all TQFTs, he nce topological
orders. In 2003 I made a conjecture that if the number of parti cle types
is ﬁxed, then there are only ﬁnitely many TQFTs. The best appr oach is
basedontheconcept ofmodulartensorcategory (MTC)[T][BK ]. Amodular
tensor category encodes the algebraic data insidea TQFT, an ddescribes the
consistency of an anyonic system. Modular tensor category m ight be a very
useful concept to study topological quantum systems. In 200 3 I gave a
lecture at the American Institute of Mathematics to an audie nce of mostly
condensed matter physicists. It was recognized by one of the participants,
Prof. Xiao-gang Wen of MIT, that indeed tensor category is us eful for
physicists as his recent works have shown.
Recently S. Belinschi, R. Stong, E. Rowell and myself have ac hieved the
classiﬁcation of all MTCs up to 4 labels. The result has not be en written up
yet, but the list is surprisingly short. Each fusion rule is r ealized by either
a Chern-Simons TQFT and its quantum double. For example, the fusion
rules of self-dual, singly generated modular tensor catego ries up to rank=4
are realized by: SU(2) level=1, SO(3) level=3, SU(2) level=2, SO(3) level
5,SU(2) level=3.
8.Open questions
There are many open problems in the subject and directions to pursue for
mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists. We ju st mention a few
here. The most important for the program is whether or not the re are non-
abelian anyons in Nature. Another question is to understand the boundary
(1+1) quantum ﬁeld theories of topological quantum systems . Most of the
boundary QFTs are conformal ﬁeld theories. What is the relat ion of the
boundary QFT with the bulk TQFT? How do we classify them?
Quantum mechanics has been incorporated into almost every p hysical
theory in the last century. Mathematics is experiencing the same now.
Wavefunctions may well replace the digital numbers as the ne w notation to
describe our world. The nexus among quantum topology, quant um physics
and quantum computation will lead to a better understanding of our uni-
verse, and Prof. Chern would be happy to see how important a ro le that his
Chern-Simons theory is playing in this new endeavor.

mechanics itself [1]. Indeed already during the beginning years of qua ntum mechanics, the
formalism that is now referred to as standard quantum mechanics [2 ], was thought to be
too speciﬁc by the founding fathers themselves. One of the quest ions that obviously was at
the origin of this early dissatisfaction is: ‘Why would a complex Hilbert sp ace deliver the
unique mathematical structure for a complete description of the m icroworld? Would that
not be amazing? What is so special about a complex Hilbert space that its mathematical
structure would play such a fundamental role?’
Let us turn for a moment to the other great theory of physics, na mely general rela-
tivity, to raise more suspicion towards the fundamental role of the complex Hilbert space
for quantum mechanics. General relativity is founded on the mathe matical structure of
Riemann geometry. In this case however it is much more plausible that indeed the right
fundamental mathematical structure has been taken. Riemann d eveloped his theory as a
synthesis of the work of Gauss, Lobatsjevski and Bolyai on non- Euclidean geometry, and
his aim was to work out a theory for the description of the geometric al structure of the
world in all its generality. Hence Einstein took recourse to the work o f Riemann to express
his ideas and intuitions on space time and its geometry and this lead to g eneral relativity.
General relativity could be called in this respect ‘the geometrization o f a part of the world
including gravitation’.
There is, of course, a deﬁnite reason why von Neumann used the ma thematical struc-
ture of a complex Hilbert space for the formalization of quantum mec hanics, but this
reason is much less profound than it is for Riemann geometry and gen eral relativity. The
reason is that Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics and Schr¨ odinger’s wa ve mechanics turned
out to be equivalent, the ﬁrst being a formalization of the new mecha nics making use
ofl2, the set of all square summable complex sequences, and the secon d making use of
L2(R3), the set of all square integrable complex functions of three real variables. The two
spacesl2andL2(R3) are canonical examples of a complex Hilbert space. This means that

Heisenberg and Schr¨ odinger were working already in a complex Hilber t space, when they
formulated matrix mechanics andwave mechanics, without being awa re ofit. This made it
a straightforward choice for von Neumann to propose a formulatio n of quantum mechanics
in an abstract complex Hilbert space, reducing matrix mechanics and wave mechanics to
two possible speciﬁc representations.
One problem with the Hilbert space representation was known fromt he start. A (pure)
state of a quantum entity is represented by a unit vector or ray of the complex Hilbert
space, and not by a vector. Indeed vectors contained in the same ray represent the same
state or one has to renormalize the vector that represents the s tate after it has been
changed in one way or another. It is well known that if rays of a vect or space are called
points and two dimensional subspaces of this vector space are calle d lines, the set of points
and lines corresponding in this way to a vector space, form a projec tive geometry. What
we just remarked about the unit vector or ray representing the s tate of the quantum
entity means that in some way the projective geometry correspon ding to the complex
Hilbert space represents more intrinsically the physics of the quant um world as does the
Hilbert space itself. This state of aﬀairs is revealed explicitly in the dyn amics of quantum
entities, that is built by using group representations, and one has t o consider projective
representations, which are representations in the correspondin g projective geometry, and
not vector representations [3].
The title of the article by John von Neumann and Garett Birkhoﬀ [1] th at we men-
tioned as the founding article for operational quantum axiomatics is ‘The logic of quantum
mechanics’. LetusexplainshortlywhatBirkhoﬀandvonNeumanndoin thisarticle. First
ofall they remarkthat anoperationalpropositionofa quantum en tity isrepresented inthe
standard quantum formalism by an orthogonal projection operat or or by the correspond-
ing closed subspace of the Hilbert space H. Let us denote the set of all closed subspaces
ofHbyL(H). Next Birkhoﬀ and von Neumann show that the structure of L(H) is not
that of a Boolean algebra, the archetypical structure of the set of propositions in classical
logic. More speciﬁcally it is the distributive law between conjunction an d disjunction
(a∨b)∧c= (a∧c)∨(b∧c) (1)
that is not necessarily valid for the case of quantum propositions a,b,c∈ L(H). A whole
line of research, called quantum logic, was born as a consequence of the Birkhoﬀ and von
Neumann article. The underlying philosophical idea is that, inthesame manner as general
relativity has introduced non-Euclidean geometry into the reality of the physical world,
quantum mechanics introduces non-Boolean logic. The quantum par adoxes would be due
to the fact that we reason with Boolean logic about situations with qu antum entities,
while these situations should be reasoned about with non-Boolean log ic.
Although fascinating as an approach [4], it is not this idea that is at the origin of quan-
tum axiomatics. Another aspect of what Birkhoﬀ and von Neumann d id in their article
is that they shifted the attention on the mathematical structure of the set of operational
propositions L(H) instead of the Hilbert space Hitself. In this sense it is important to
pay attention to the fact that L(H) is the set of all operational propositions, i.e.the
set of yes/no experiments on a quantum entity. They opened a way to connect abstract
mathematical concepts of the quantum formalism, namely the orth ogonal projection op-
erators or closed subspaces of the Hilbert space, directly with phy sical operations in the
laboratory, namely the yes/no experiments.
2
George Mackey followed in on this idea when he wrote his book on the ma thematical
foundations of quantum mechanics [5]. He starts the other way aro und and considers as
a basis the set Lof all operational propositions, meaning propositions being testab le by
yes/no experiments on a physical entity. Then he introduces as an axiom that this set L
has to have a structure isomorphic to the set of all closed subspac esL(H) of a complex
Hilbert space in the case of a quantum entity. He states that it would be interesting to
invent a set of axioms on Lthat gradually would make Lmore and more alike to L(H) to
ﬁnally arrive at an isomorphism when all the axioms are satisﬁed. While M ackey wrote his
book results as such were underway. A year later Constantin Piron proved a fundamental
representationtheorem. Startingfromtheset Lofalloperationalpropositionsofaphysical
entity and introducing ﬁve axioms on Lhe proved that Lis isomorphic to the set of closed
subspaces L(V) of a generalized Hilbert space Vwhenever these ﬁve axioms are satisﬁed
[6]. Let us elaborate on some of the aspects of this representation theorem to be able to
explain further what operational quantum axiomatics is about.
We mentioned already that Birkhoﬀ and von Neumann had noticed tha t the set of
closed subspaces L(H) of a complex Hilbert space His not a Boolean algebra, because
distributivity between conjunction and disjunction, like expressed in (1), is not satisﬁed.
The set of closed subspaces of a complex Hilbert space forms howev er a lattice, which
is a more general mathematical structure than a Boolean algebra, moreover, a lattice
where the distributivity rule (1) is satisﬁed is a Boolean algebra, which indicates that the
lattice structure is the one to consider for the quantum mechanica l situation. To make
again a reference to general relativity, the lattice structure is ind eed to a Boolean algebra
what general Riemann geometry is to Euclidean geometry. And more over, meanwhile it
has been understood why the structure of operational proposit ions of the world is not a
Boolean algebra but a lattice. This is due to the fact that measureme nts can have an
uncontrollable inﬂuence on the state of the physical entity under c onsideration [7]. Hence
the intuition of Birkhoﬀ and von Neumann, and later Mackey, Piron an d others, although
only mathematical intuition at that time, was correct.
Axiomatic quantum mechanics is more than just an axiomatization of q uantum me-
chanics. Because of the operational nature of the axiomatization , it holds the potential for
‘more general theories than standard quantum mechanics’ which h owever are ‘quantum
like theories’. In this sense, we believe that it is one of the candidates to generate the
framework for the new theory to be developed generalizing quantu m mechanics and rela-
tivity theory [7]. Let us explain why we believe that operational quant um axiomatics has
the potential to deliver such a generalization of relativity theory an d quantum mechan-
ics. General relativity is a theory that brings part of the world that in earlier Newtonian
mechanics was classiﬁed within dynamics to the geometrical realm of r eality, and more
speciﬁcally confronting us with the pre-scientiﬁc and naive realistic v ision on space, time,
matter and gravitation. It teaches us in a deep and new way, compa red to Newtonian
physics, ‘what are the things that exists and how they exist and are related and how they
inﬂuence each other’. But there is one deep lack in relativity theory: it does not take into
account the inﬂuence of the observer, the eﬀect that the measu ring apparatus has on the
thing observed. It does not confront the subject-object prob lem and its inﬂuence on how
reality is. It cannot do this because its mathematical apparatus is b ased on the Riemann
geometry of time-space, hence prejudicing that time-space is the re, ﬁlled up with ﬁelds
and matter, that are also there, independent of the observer. T here is no fundamental
3
role for the creation of ‘new’ within relativity theory, everything ju st ‘is’ and we are only
there to ‘detect’ how this everything ‘is’. That is also the reason why general relativity
can easily be interpreted as delivering a model for the whole universe , whatever this would
mean. We know that quantum mechanics takes into account in an ess ential way the eﬀect
of the observer through the measuring apparatus on the state o f the physical entity under
study. In a theory generalizing quantum mechanics and relativity, s uch that both appear
as special cases, this eﬀect should certainly also appear in a fundam ental way. We believe
that general relativity has explored to great depth the question ‘h ow can things bein the
world’. Quantum axiomatics explores in great depth the question ‘how can beactedin
the world’. And it does explore this question of ‘action in the world’ in a v ery similar
manner as general relativity theory does with its question of ‘being o f the world’. This
means that operational quantum axiomatics can be seen as the dev elopment of a general
theory of ‘actions in the world’ in the same manner that Riemann geom etry can be seen
as a general theory of ‘geometrical forms existing in the world’. Of c ourse Riemann is not
equivalent to general relativity, a lotofdetailed physics hadtobekn own toapplyRiemann
resulting in general relativity. This is the same with operational quan tum axiomatics, it
has the potential to deliver the framework for the theory genera lizing quantum mechanics
and relativity theory.
We want to remark that in principle a theory that describes the poss ible actions in
the world, and a theory that delivers a model for the whole universe , should not be
incompatible. It should even be so that the theory that delivers a mo del of the whole
universe should incorporate the theory of actions in the world, whic h would mean for the
situation that exists now, general relativity should contain quantu m mechanics, if it really
delivers a model for the whole universe. That is why we believe that Ein stein’s attitude,
trying toincorporatetheotherforces andinteractions within gen eral relativity, contraryto
common believe, was the right one, globally speaking. What Einstein did not know at that
timewas‘therealityofnon-localityinthemicro-world’. Non-localitymea nsnon-spatiality,
which means that the reality of the micro-world, and hence the realit y of the universe as a
whole, is not time-space like. Time-space is not the global theatre of reality, but rather a
crystallization and structuration of the macro-world. Time-space has come into existence
together with the macroscopic material entities, and hence it is ‘the ir’ time and space, but
it is not the theatre of the microscopic quantum entities. This fact is the fundamental
reasonwhy general relativity, built onthemathematical geometric al Riemannianstructure
of time-space, cannot be the canvas for the new theory to be dev eloped. A way to express
this technically would be to say that the set of events cannot be iden tiﬁed with the set of
time-space points as is done inrelativity theory. Recourse will have t o be taken to a theory
that describes reality as a kind of pre-geometry, and where the ge ometrical structure arises
as a consequence of interactions that collapse into the time-space context. We believe that
operational quantum axiomatics can deliver the framework as well a s the methodology to
construct and elaborate such a theory.
Mackey and Piron introduced the set of yes/no experiments but th en immediately
shifted to an attempt to axiomatize mathematically the lattice of (op erational) proposi-
tions of a quantum entity, Mackey postulating right away an isomorp hism with L(H) and
Piron giving ﬁve axioms to come as close as possible to L(H). Also Piron’s axioms are
however mostly motivated by mimicking mathematically the structure ofL(H). In later
work Piron made a stronger attempt to found operationally part of the axioms [8], and
4
this attempt was worked out further in [9], to arrive at a full operat ional foundation only
recently [7].
Also mathematically the circle was closed only recently. There do exist a lot of ﬁnite
dimensional generalized Hilbert spaces that are diﬀerent from the t hree standard exam-
ples, real, complex and quaternionic Hilbert space. But since a physic al entity has to have
at least a position observable, it follows that the generalized Hilbert s pace must be inﬁnite
dimensional. At the time when Piron gave his ﬁve axioms that lead to the representa-
tion within a generalized Hilbert space, there only existed three exam ples of generalized
Hilbert spaces that ﬁtted all the axioms, namely real, complex and qu aternionic Hilbert
space. Years later Hans Keller constructed the ﬁrst counterexa mple, more speciﬁcally an
example of an inﬁnite dimensional generalized Hilbert space that is not isomorphic to
one of the three standard Hilbert spaces [10]. The study of genera lized Hilbert spaces,
nowadays also called orthomodular spaces, developed into a resear ch subject of its own,
and recently Maria Pia Sol` er proved a groundbreaking theorem in t his ﬁeld. She proved
that an inﬁnite dimensional generalized Hilbert space that contains a n orthonormal base
is isomorphic with one of the three standard Hilbert spaces [11]. It ha s meanwhile also
been possible to formulate an operational axiom, called ‘plane transit ivity’ on the set of
operational propositions that implies Sol` er’s condition [12], which co mpletes the axiomat-
ics for standard quantum mechanics by means of six axioms, the orig inal ﬁve axioms of
Piron and plane transitivity as sixth axiom.
An interesting and rather recent evolution is taking place, where qu antum structures,
as developed within this operational approach to quantum axiomatic s, are used to model
entities in regions of reality diﬀerent of the micro-world [13, 14, 15, 1 6, 17, 18, 19, 20]. We
believe that also this is a promising evolution in the way to understand d eeper and more
clearly the meaning of quantum mechanics in all of its aspects.

I.Introduction  
The uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics was first introduced in 1927 by W. 
Heisenberg, which show s that the more exactly the position of one particle is decided, the less 
exactly the momentum of the particle can be determined, and vice versa [1]. The current 
inequality depending on the standard deviation of position and momentum was deduced by E. H. 
Kennard later [2]  and by H. Weyl in 1928 [3] .  
The uncertainty principle practically shows a basic physics  law character  of systems in 
quantum physics , and isn’t one  statement of the observational success of current technology  [4]. 
Some pioneer researchers gave excellent investigations on uncertainty principle [5 -9], 
Ref.[10] studied microscopic origin for the apparent uncertainty principle governing the 
anomalous attenuation, further, m acroscopic quantum uncertainty principle and superfl uid 
hydrodynamics were  investigated [11], Ref.[12] researched on undecidability principle and the 
uncertainty principle even for classical systems. Ref.[13] studied hierarchy of local minimum 
solutions of Heisenberg's uncertainty p rinciple , furthermore, no ncommutative spacetime, stringy 
spacetime uncertainty principle, and density fluctuations were shown [14].   
A. Bina, S. Jalalzadeh  and A. Moslehi showed  a quantum  black hole in the generalized 
uncertainty principle framework [15],  and Ref.[16] gave a unification theory of classical statistical 
uncertainty relation and quantum uncertainty relation and its applications.  Pierre Nataf, Mehmet 
Dogan  and Karyn Le Hur further revealed Heisenberg uncertainty principle as a probe of 
entanglement entropy: Applic ation to superradiant quantum phase transitions [1 7]. 
2 
 Giuseppe Vallone, Davide G. Marangon, Marco Tomasin and Paolo Villoresi show quantum 
randomness certified by the uncertainty principle [1 8], Smail Bougouffa and Zbigniew Ficek 
further reveal evidence of  indistinguishability and entanglement determined by the energy -time 
uncertainty principle in a system of two strongly coupled bosonic modes [1 9]. Furthermore, L. 
Perivolaropoulos gives  research on cosmological horizons, uncertainty principle, and maximum 
length quantum mechanics [ 20]. 
Shmuel Friedland, Vlad Gheorghiu, and Gilad Gour give universal uncertainty relations [2 1], 
and Andre C. Barato and Udo Seifert further present thermodynamic uncertainty relation for 
biomolecular processes [2 2]. 
Since we study the general physical laws of  any quantum systems of  arbitrary space, so far 
there is no the corresponding arbitrary uncertainty principle , so we need to study and give 
arbitrary uncertain ty principle.  
So far in quantum  physics , all the uncertainty re lation s are, for  the highest considering , the 
uncertain ty relationship about  variance level, higher  order uncertainty relation can not be given out, 
which leads to , when doing the measurement of a ny orders  of two arbitrary physical quantities in 
the real cases, various statistical accuracies are  not high, the most general estimation s and 
calculations  of physics  quantities can not be done for general different physics system s. 
Because this paper is concerned with any physical system of arbitrary space, so we have to 
generalize the original uncertain principle  to the most general case, therefore, in this paper, we 
will solve the theory and representation problem of new any order uncertainty principle of any two 
physica l quantities, which cannot be solved so far.  
This paper is arranged as follows: Sect. two gives a new general unequal theorem in 
mathematics and a general  useful inequality of any orders  of function s of two operators ; Sect. 
three is new universal uncertain ty principle  of general physics quantities in quantum physics; Sect. 
four shows research on a moving particle with mass in a general central force field; Sect. five 
presents more application s of this theory; Sect. six shows new general uncertainty relations of 
general physics quantities in classic statistics; Sect. seven gives summary, conclusion  and outlook.

Multiplying inequality (2.5) with

and integrating , thus we obtain inequality (2.4).  
For a general relation between quantum physics and classic  physics, physical consistent 
property demands that there is a fundamental result that the quantum  average value of any 
operator in quantum physics is equal to the  relative  statistical average value of the classic physics 
quantity  corresponding to its quantum operator , which can be mathematically expressed as [16,25]  
ˆ X d X d X d            

where 
ˆX ’s concrete  function  expression  (e.g., 
ˆpi 
 ) is generally different from 
X ’s 
concrete function expression  (e.g., 
p mr
 ), but their average values are the same, which is just 
physics consistence demand ; for any classic real density, it always can be  written as  the product of 
a complex function and its complex conjugate function, i.e., 
   , and we take the complex 
function as the corresponding wave function of quantum mechanics . Vice ver sa, i.e., we can take 
the product of a quantum wave function and its complex conjugate wave function as classic 
density, namely , 
   .  
4 
 When statistical  density 
  of classic  physics  is not dep endent on the corresponding classic 
physics quantity , then the statistical average value of the corresponding quantum  physics quantity 
is just degenerated  from Eq.(2.6) as the value of the corresponding classic physics quantity [ 16,25 ].

Because 
ˆX  is any operator, which may naturally  be a composite  function of operator s

III. New universal uncertainty principle  of general physics quantities in quantum 
physics  
 
From current quantum uncertainty principle mathematic s derivation and analysis of the entire 
physic s’ build ing process, only simply taking  Schwarz inequality related to the variance of two 
physical quantities in the uncertainty description  of the same time measurement  is just a special case , 
because , according to a general principle, a real system  of quantum physics  also abounds non -Schwarz 
inequality to calculate measurement uncertainty description of the variance of two physical quantities 
at the same time, the variance description  relating to  Schwarz inequality  is just a special case of them . 
Consequently,  the current quantum theory about the description of the uncertainty principle is not 
comprehensive , not perfect  and not strict enough, to overcome these shortcomings, we now need to put 
it to the most general case  
Now we use inequality (2.10) to deduce new uncertainty principle  of any orders  of two 
physical quantities in quantum physics in following studies.  
For any operators 
ˆˆ,AB , we take 
ˆ ˆˆ ˆ ˆˆ ˆ ˆ, f A A A g B B B         and 
substituting them into inequality (2.10), we have

problems of central force fields in quantum mechanics , atomic physics  and so on .

 when the bound state is d isintegrated . Thus, expressions (4.11) -(4.13) have extensive uses 
in qu antum mechanics, atomic physics  and so on, because they are very general expressions, 
9 
 which cannot be given in the current quantum the ories.  
For example, we consider the most common expression of  Lennard -Jones potential  ( a useful  
model for the interaction of a pair of neutral atoms or molecules  ) [28] 
12 64 [( ) ( ) ]LJVrr

where σ is a distance of the inter -particle potential being  zero, ε is a depth of a potential well , r is a 
distance between the  two particles , the Lennard -Jones potential is extensively and accurately used 
in computer simulations  [28]. 
The r−12 term describes, at short ranges, Pauli repulsion due to overlapping electron orbitals,  
and the r−6 term describes , at long ranges,  attraction  (dispersion force or van der Waals force) .

Thus we see that not only all quantities are with the same dimensions between two sides of 
inequality (5.9), but also their coefficient s of two sides satisfy the inequality. 
Consequently, it can be seen that i nequality (5.1 0) just shows the correction of inequality (5.6)  
in real physical experiments . 
These are consistent with all the known results and include the achieved successes in 
quantum theory.   
Using inequality (3. 4), we can give all uncertainty relations of any orders  of two physical 
quantities, which can be applied to atomic physics , quantum mechanics, quantum communications , 
quantum calculations , quantum computer  and so on , e.g., to Refs.  [12-21].

Inequality ( 6.4) is just the well -known Schwarz inequality . Therefore, our studies are consistent 
with current statistical theory.  
 
VII. Summary , conclusion  and outlook  
We first simply review the development of uncertainty principle,  and then use a general 
unequal lemma to deduce a general u nequal theorem  of any orders  of any two functions  with 
integrations .  
This paper deduces an important relation  between a composite  function of operators  in 
quantum physics  and a composite  function of classic physics quantities corresponding  the 
operators, further utilize s the relation and the unequal theorem  to achieve a general important  
inequality . Using the inequality, we show new  universal uncertainty principle  in different quantum 
theories , namely,  new universal uncertainty principle  of any orders of physical quantities  in 
quantum physics, overcome the difficulty that current quantum computer , quantum 
communication, quantum control and so on  theories cannot give exact  values of  general 
uncertainty of any orders of physical quantities , further , we give all relevant different expressions  
of the universal uncertainty principle  and their applications.  
    For examples, inequality  (3.4) is just the new uncertainty principle  of any orders  of physical 
quantities  in quantum physics . When p=q, inequality (3. 4) can be further simplified as inequality  
(3.5); when p=2, inequality (3. 5) can be further simplified as the well -known usual unc ertain ty 
principle expression . Therefore, our studies are consistent with current theory  and real physical 
experiments, e.g., relevant to hydrogen  atom physics ex periments . 
For a moving particle with mass in  a general  central force field , using Virial theorem, we 
achieve a new general average  value relationship (4.2) between kinetic energy and potential 
energy in any bound state , thus we deduce  the total energy  (4.3) proportional to 
1/r
(
0< 2 ). 
Furthermore , for the general potential, we generally deduce  a new radial general interesting 
inequality 
1/pq
qp q p q prr      (4.5) , which  cannot be deduced in the past  and can give 
many new applications in relevant redial calculations in different qu antum theories .  
We further achieve a new key important inequality

 (0 < p, q < ∞ ), when p=q=2, which is just the well -known usual uncertain ty relation 
between 
ix  and 
ˆjp . Therefore, our studies are again concretely consistent with current theory.  
13 
 On the other hand, using the deduced unequal theorem, unequal expression (2.4) can be 
simplified as inequality (6.1), when p=q=2 , inequality (6.1) can be  further simplified as the 
well-known Schwarz inequality. Therefore, our studies are consistent with current functional 
theory.  
Using the new universal uncertainty principle  expression  (3.4), we can give all uncertainty 
relations of any orders  of physical quantities  in quantum physics , which can be applied to quantum 
mechanics,  quantum communication, quantum calculations  and so on , because, in these theories, 
they all use quantum theories and the uncertainty relation to investigate an d solve their relevant 
problems . 
Therefore,  this paper opens a new area investigating new universal uncertainty principle  of 
any orders of physics quantities in quantum physics, the achieved  results in this paper  are useful , 
because this paper will influence the research of others in physics .  
For any statistical system, it is usually necessary to give a description of all h igh order statistical 
moments in order to give a rigorous statistical description theory [30]. The same is true for any 
quantum statistical physics system [25,30]. In the current theory of quantum statistical physics systems, 
there is only the same time me asurement uncertainty description of the variance of two physical 
quantities [25, 30], and a lot of the rests of the more, stricter and more general descriptions so far has 
not been given. This paper just gives these descriptions that so far have still not  been given, which 
overcome the difficulty  that it is not possible to strictly describe the physical systems related to the 
aspect of the universal uncertainty principle , so as to give a new general description theory of the 
quantum physics relating to the universal uncertainty principle .

Probabilistic Computer Grammars
The preceding chapter described the production rules for a
deterministic grammar. The left si de of each production rule has one,
and only one, possible transition.
Non-deterministic grammars allow tw o or more grammar rules to have
the same left side and differe nt right sides. For example,
A → y
A → x
could both appear in a non-deterministic grammar.
Non-deterministic grammars ar e naturally associated with
probabilities. The probabilities can  be classical probabilities or
quantum probabilities. An exampl e of a simple non-deterministic
grammar is:The head symbol is the letter S. Th e terminal symbols are the letters x
and y.  The production rules are:
S → xy Rule I
x → xx Rule II   Relative Probability = .75
x → xy Rule III  Relative Probability = .25
y → yy Rule IV
The probability of generating th e string xxy vs. the probability of
generating the string xyy from the string xy is
xy → xxy relative probability = .75
vs.
xy → xyy relative probability = .25
The string xxy is three times more lik ely to be produced than the string
xyy.
For each starting string one can obta in the relative probabilities that
various possible output strings will be produced.
A more practical example of a Probabilistic Grammar can be
abstracted from flipping coins – heads or tails occur with equal
probability – 50-50. From this obs ervation we can create a little
Probabilistic Grammar for the case of  flipping two coins. Let us  let h
represent heads and t re present tails. Then let us choose the grammar:
S → hh
S → tt
S → ht
S → th
h → t probability = .5  (50%)
h → h probability = .5  (50%)
t → h probability = .5 (50%)
2t → t probability = .5 (50%)
The last four rules above embody th e statement that flipping a coin
yields heads or tails with e qual probability (50% or .5).
Now let us consider starting with  two heads hh. The possible outcomes
and their probabilities are:
hh → hh probability = .5 * .5 = .25
hh → th probability = .5 * .5 = .25
hh → ht probability = .5 * .5 = .25
hh → tt probability = .5 * .5 = .25
If we don’t care about the order of the output heads and tails then the
probability of two heads hh → ht or th is .25 + .25 = .5.
This simple example shows th e basic thought process of a non-
deterministic grammar with associated probabilities.
The combination of a non-deterministic  grammar and an associated set
of probabilities for tran sitions can be called a Probabilistic Grammar .
We will see that the grammar produc tion rules for the Standard Model
must be viewed as constituting a Probabilistic Grammar™ with one
difference. The “square roots” of pr obabilities – probability amplitudes
are specified for the transitions in the grammar. Probability amplitudes
are required by the Standard Model because it is a quantum theory.
Therefore we will call the gram mar of the Standard Model a Quantum
Probabilistic Grammar™ .

What are Turing Machines?
The linguistic view of the Stan dard Model leads to a number of
questions. One important question is the nature of the Turing machine
that accepts this language. A Turing machine is a generalizedtheoretical computer that is ofte n used to analyze computational
questions in computer science.
A personal computer can be viewed as a special purpose Turing
machine. A personal computer has memory in the form of RAM and
hard disks. A personal computer ha s built-in programs that tell it what
to do when data is input into the computer. Similarly a Turing machine
also has memory and instructions within it telling it how to handle
input and how to produce output from a given input.When we type input on a computer keyboard or have input come from
another source such as the Internet or  a data file, the input has to be in
a form that the computer can handle. Similarly, the input for a Turingmachine must have a specific form for the Turing machine to accept it,
process it and then produce output. In  the case of a Turing machine we
say the input must be presented in  a language that the Turing machine
“accepts”. In this context the word “accepts” means a format that theTuring machine can recognize and anal yze so that it can process the
data to produce output.
The language of the Standard Model is a type 0 computer language. A
type 0 language requires a Turing machine to handle its productions.
Because particle transitions are quant um and because the left side of a
production rule can have several possi ble right sides (For example, a
photon can transition to an electr on-positron pair, a quark-antiquark
pair and so on.) the Turing machin e for the Standard Model language
must be a non-deterministic Quantum Turing Machine.
Features of Normal Turing Machines
Before examining a Quantum Turing Machine for the Standard Model
we will look at the features of “normal” Turing machines. A normal
Turing machine consists of a fin itely describable black box  (its
features are describable in a fi nite number of statements) and an
infinite tape. The tape plays the ro le of computer memory. The tape is
divided into squares. Each square c ontains a symbol or character. The
character can be the “blank” charac ter or a symbol. A tape contains
blank characters followed by a finite  string of input symbols followed
by blank characters.
The black box consists of a control part and a tape head. The control
part has a finite set of rules built into it (the “program”) and a finite
memory that it uses as a scratch pad normally. The tape head can read
symbols from the tape one at a time and can move the tape to the left,right, or not move it, based on inst ructions from the control part.
The tape head tells the control the symbols it is scanning from the tape
and the control decides what action to have the tape perform based on
the scanned symbols and information (the program and data) stored inthe control’s memory.

Tape
Figure. Schematic diagram of a Turing machine.A set of input symbols is placed on the tape and the rules (program) in
the control part are applied to produce an output set of symbols.
This process is analogous to elementary  particle processe s: an input set
of particles interacts through various  forces of nature and produces an
output set of particles. The differe nce is that elementary particle
processes are quantum probabilistic in nature. The laws of Physics
(which appear to be fi nitely describable since they can be specified by
the Standard Model lagrangian except for gravity) play the role of the
finite set of rules.
Quantum Probabilistic Grammars
The major difference between Turi ng machine outputs and the outputs
in particle physics are that outpu t states in particle physics are
quantum probabilistic. A given set of  input symbols (particles) can
produce a variety of output states  with different probabilitiescalculable in the Standard Mode l. We need a Quantum Turing
Machine to handle this more complex situation.
Quantum (and non-quantum) Turing Mach ines can be pictured in a
convenient way by viewing the contro l part as containing a tape on
which the rules are inscribed, the cu rrent state of the Turing machine is
specified, and the current symbol being scanned by the tape head is
stored.
The grammar rules of a Quantum Turing Machine are quantum
probabilistic. In the simplest case eac h grammar rule has an associated
number that we will call its relative probability amplitude. We will callthis type of Quantum Probabilistic Grammar™ a factorable Quantum
Probabilistic Grammar . The calculation of th e probability for a
transition from a specifi ed input string to a specified output string is
based on the following rules:
1. The relative probability amplit ude for an input string to be
transformed to a specified output  string is the sum of relative
probability amplitudes for each possible sequence of transitionsthat leads from the input string to the output string.
2. The relative probability amplitude for a sequence of
grammar rule transitions is the product of the relativeprobability amplitudes of each transition.
3. The relative probability for an input string to be transformed
to an output string is the absolu te value squared of the relative
probability amplitude for the input  string to be transformed to
the output string.
4. The absolute probability for an input string to be
transformed to a specified output string is the relative
probability for the input string to be transformed to the
specified output string divide d by the sum of the relative
probabilities for the input string to be transformed to all
possible output strings using the grammar rules. This rule
guarantees the sum of the probabilities sums to one.                       Control Part

The Standard Model Quantum Turing Machine
The Quantum Turing Machine that co rresponds to the Standard Model
has a number of exciting features th at distinguish it from conventional
Turing Machines.
First it accepts a language that has a finitely describable entangled
Quantum Grammar™. Although the Sta ndard Model has an entangled
Quantum Grammar the grammar rules ar e finitely describable. Finitely
describable means that the rules can  be specified by a finite set of
symbols. The rules generated from the interactions of the Standard
Model are finite in number and each rule consists of a finite number ofsymbols. Thus the rules generated from the Standard Model arefinitely describable.
A Quantum Turing Machine can be visualized as consisting of a
control element and two tapes that pl ay the role of computer memory.
The control has a tape head that re ads and writes symbols to the two
tapes.Tape I contains the specification of  the grammar rules expressed as a
finite string of symbols, the cu rrent state of the Quantum Turing
Machine, and other data. Tape II  contains the input string. After
applying the grammar rules in a quantum probabilistic way an outputstate is generated. The output state is placed on Tape II in the simplest
Quantum Turing Machine implementation.

Figure. Quantum Turing Machine. Ta pe I plays the role of computer
memory. Tape II is memory for input and output.
The behavior of a Quantum Turing Machine can be viewed as:1. The Turing machine begins in the input state specif ied on tape II.
An input string is placed on tape II. The other memory locations on
tape II are filled with blank charact ers. In our case this string is a
list of symbols for an input set of  elementary particles that are
about to interact. The Turing mach ine we are considering accepts
any state consisting of a finite num ber of elementary particles. The   Control
Tape Head
7connection between Turing machines and computer languages is
brought out at this stage. A m achine “accepts” a language if it can
take any sentence (set of particle s in our case) of the language, and
perform a computation producing out put (a set of output particles
in our case). A Turing machine that accepts a language is an
embodiment of the grammar of the language.
2. The Quantum Turing Machine appl ies the grammar rules to the
input set of states in all possibl e ways to produce an output state
that is a quantum superposition of states. Each possible output state
has a certain probability of being produced.
3. The probability for producing a specified output state from a
specified input state can be calculated as we illustrated in a simple
example earlier using the relative probabilities associated with the
Quantum Grammar™ rules of the modified &3 theory.
4. The set of possible states of a Quantum Turing Machine1 is infinite
unlike non-Quantum Turing Machin es that only have a finite
number of possible states.
The Standard Model Quantum Turing Machine has some distinctive
features:
1. Since the order of the particles in the input state string is not
physically important we will c onsider the input string to be
actually all permutations of the or der of the partic les in the input.
2. Since the Turing machine is quantum the rules are probabilistic in
nature: a given set of  input particles will in general produce many
possible output particle states. Each  output state will have a certain
                                                
1 D. Deutsch, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, A 400 97 (1985)
describes (universal) Quantum Computers and points out they can simulate
continuous physical systems because they  have a continuum (infinite number) of
possible states. As page 107 points ou t “a quantum computer has an infinite-
dimensional state space”. Quantum Computers are equivalent to Quantum Turing
Machines as we will see.probability of being produced that  can be calculated using the
Standard Model.
3. The Quantum Grammar™ rules of the Standard Model Quantum
Turing Machine have internal symmetries that result in symmetriesin the input and output states.
4. Since the momenta and spins of th e input and output particles are
physically very important the Standard Model Quantum Turing
Machine must take account of th ese properties in the input and
output states as well as intern ally when calculating transition
probabilities.
So we must picture the input particle state on ta pe II as containing not
only the particle symbol but also momenta and spin data.
To get an idea of how a Quantum Turing Machine would take an input
set of particles and pr oduce a set of output part icles we will consider
the case of two electrons colliding with such energy that an electron-
positron pair is created:
ee →  eepe
where e represents an electron and p represents a positron (the
electron’s antiparticle). One of the corresponding Feynman-like
diagrams is:
8      1    2     3 4              5
e         e
              γ
         e
      
        
        p
                                                     γ
                     e              e
where γ represents a photon. The input string can change according to
the grammar rules in the following way:
ee → eγe → eγγe → eepγe → eepe
Since the Quantum Turing Machine is probabilistic there are many –
in fact an infinite number – of ways in which the transition
ee → eepe
can take place – each with its own probability of happening. The
sample sequence of transitions s hown above is only one of these
possible ways. The total probability of this transition is the square ofthe sum of the probability amplit udes for all possible ways according
to quantum mechanics. Nature requ ires us to take account of all
possible ways of transitioning from th e input state of particles to the
output state of particles. The total probability of the output state beingproduced is a sum of the contributi ons of all the possible alternate
ways of reaching that output state.
In addition, electron-electron scat tering can produce many other output
states depending on the initial energy of the electrons. Each output
state has its own probability of occurring. Some examples are:
          
ee → eqqe
ee → eepepe
 ee → eµµe
ee → eµµepe
where q represents a quark, µ represents the muon antiparticle and q
represents an antiquark.  
The Quantum Turing Machine representation does raise several
interesting prospects fo r the theory of elemen tary particles embodied
in the Standard Model. Firs t, the Quantum Turing Machine
representation raises the possibil ity that some of the powerful
techniques and general results of the theory of computation can be
brought over to physics and perhap s provide guidance on the next
stage after the Standard Model.
Secondly, and perhaps more importan tly, the separati on of the input
and output states (they are on ta pe II) from the intermediate
calculational states of the Turing machine (that are on tape I) issuggestive of a somewhat different  approach to the fundamentals of
particle interactions: The spa ce-time of the incoming and outgoing
particles may be different from the “space-time” describing the
interactions and internal structure of the interacting particles. This
view is based on thinking of tapes I and II as representing separate
space-times.
9A precursor of this point of view appears in Quantum Field Theory. In
Quantum Field Theory the interact ion of particles is viewed as
consisting of three phases: an init ial state where the particles are
widely separated and distinct, an in teraction region wh ere the particles
“collide” and interact perhaps creati ng new particles, and a final state
where the outgoing particle s are widely separated.
Figure. Two particles collide and generate a three particle outgoing
state in Quantum Field Theory.
In conventional Quantum Field Theory the space-time in the
interacting region is conventionally assumed to be the same as the
space-time of the incoming and outgoing states. Nevertheless
Quantum Field Theory distinguishes  the interaction region from the
region of the incoming and outgoing particles.
The SuperString approach to the theory of elementary particles
introduces a separate space-time to de scribe the elementary particles.
Elementary particles are viewed as strings vibrating in this space-time.
Can one view the SuperString space -time as tape I and the external
behavior of the elementary partic les taking place in normal space-time
as tape II? Perhaps the Quantum Tu ring Machine representation of the
Standard Model is the key to th e next level of our understanding of
elementary particles and Nature.

Introduction
A natural question that arises when  one considers Quantum Computers
is the role of the Quantum Comput er processor and the operations it
supports. A further question of some  interest is whether a quantum
machine language exists and what its nature might be. Lastly the
question of higher level languages is also relevant. Can we develop a
Quantum Assembly Language™? What  is the nature of High Level
Quantum Languages™? Are there, for example, equivalents to the C
or C++ languages?Computer Machine and Assembly Languages
The traditional (non-quantum) computer  can be viewed simply as a
main memory, an accumulator or register (modern computers havemany registers), and a central pro cessing unit (CPU) that executes a
program (instructions) step by st ep. It can be visualized as:

A set of data and a program (or set of  instructions) is stored in memory
and the CPU executes the program step by step using the data to
produce an output set of data.
The basic instructions of asse mbly language and machine language
move data values between memory and the register (or registers),
manipulate the data value in the re gister and provide basic arithmetic
and logical operations2:
LOAD M   – load the value at memory location M into the
register
STORE M  – store the value in th e register at memory location
M
SHIFT k    – shift the value in the register by k bits
                                                
2 See for example Kurt Ma ly and Allen R. Hanson, Fundamentals of the Computing
Sciences  (Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1978) Chap. 8.RegisterCPU
11The following arithmetic instructions modify the value in the register.
The AND, OR and NOT instructions perform bit-wise and, or and not
operations.
ADD M     – add the value at memory location M to the value
in the register
SUBTRACT M  – subtract the value at memory location M
from the value in the register
MULTIPLY M  – multiply the va lue in the register by the
value at memory location M
DIVIDE M  – divide the value in the register by the value at
memory location M
AND M – change the value in the register by “anding” it
with the value at memory location M
OR M – change the value in  the register by “oring” it
with the value at memory location M
NOT  – change the value in the register by “not-ing” it
The following instructions implement input and output of data values.
INPUT M  – input a value storing it at memory location MOUTPUT M  –  output the value at memory location M
A computer has another register called the Program Counter. The
value in the program counter is the memory location of the next
instruction to execute. The fo llowing instructions support non-
sequential flow of control in a program. A program can “leap” from
one instruction in a program to another instruction many steps away
and resume normal sequential execution of instructions.TRA M   – set the value of the program counter to the value at
memory location M
TZR M   – set the value of the program counter to the value at
memory location M if the value inthe register is zero.
HALT     – stop execution of the program
The above set of instructions form an extremely simple assembly
language. They also are in a one-t o-one correspondence with machine
instructions (machine language). Most assembly and machinelanguages have a much more extensive set of instructions.
Algebraic Representati on of Assembly Languages
The normal view of assembly langua ge is that it has a word or
instruction oriented format. Some assembly language programmerswould even say that assembly la nguage is somewhat English-like in
part.
Computer languages in general have  tended to become more English-
like in recent years in an at tempt to make them easier for
programmers. Some view a form of highly structured English to be a
goal for computer programming languages.
In this section we follow the opposit e course and show that computer
languages can be reduced to an alge braic representation. By algebraic
we mean that the computer language  can be represented with operator
expressions using operator s that have an algebra similar to that of the
raising and lowering operators seen earlier. We will develop thealgebraic representation for the case  of the simple assembly language
described in the previous section. There are a number of reasons why
this reduction is interesting:
1. It may help to understand SuperString dynamics more
deeply (later in this chapter).
122. It will deepen our understanding of computer languages.
3. It provides a basis for th e understanding of Quantum
Computers.
4. It may have a role in resear ch on one of the major questions
of computer science: provi ng a program actually does what
it is designed to do. Algebrai c formalisms are generally
easier to prove theorems then English-like formalisms.
The algebraic representation can be defined at the level of individual
bits based on anti-commuting Fe rmi operators. But it seems more
appropriate to develop a representa tion for “words” consisting of some
number of bits. An algebraic repr esentation for a word-based assembly
language can be developed using commuting harmonic oscillator-like
raising and lowering operators.
A word consists of a number of b its. In currently popular computers
the word size is 32 bits (32-bi t computer). The size of the word
determines the largest and smallest integer that can be stored in theword. The largest integer that can  be stored in a 32-bit word is
4,294,967,294 and the smallest integer that  can be stored in a 32-bit
word is 0 if we treat words as holding unsigned integers.
To develop a simple algebraic repr esentation of assembly language we
will assume the size of a word is so  large that it can be viewed as
infinite to a good approximation. (I t is also possible to develop
algebraic representations for finite  word sizes.) As a result memory
locations can contain non-negative in tegers of arbitrarily large value.                Register

To establish the algebraic repres entation we associate a harmonic
raising operator a i@ and a lowering operator a i with each memory
location. These operators satisfy the commutation relations:
[ ai, aj@] = ij
[ ai, aj] = 0
[ ai@, aj@] = 0
where ij is 1 if i = j and zero otherwise. We define a pair of raising
and lowering operators fo r the register r and r@ with commutation
relations
[ ri, rj@] = ij
[ ri, rj] = 0

13The ground state of the computer is the state with the values at all
memory locations set to zero. It is represented by the vector
| 0, 0, 0, … > h | 0 > h V
A state of the computer will be represented by a vector of the form
| n, m, p,  … >  =  N (r@)n(a0@)m (a1@)p … | 0 >
where N is a normalization constant  and with the first number being
the value in the regi ster, the second number the value at memory
location 0, the third number the valu e at memory location 1, and so on.
For simplicity we will not consider superpositions of computer states
at this point. We will discuss supe rpositions later in this chapter.
Within this limitation we can set a computer state to have certaininitial values in memory and then have it evolve by executing a“program” to a final computer state with a different set of computervalues in memory. The “program” is  a mapping of the instructions of
an assembly language program to al gebraic expressions in the raising
and lowering operators.
Basic Operators of the Algebraic Representation
The key operators that are required for the algebraic representation are:
Fetch the Value at a Memory Location (Number Operator)
Nm = a m@am
For example,
Nm | … , n, … > = n | … , n, … >
mth memory location valueSet the Value at Memory Location m to Zero
Mm =     
(am)Nm
              ªNm!
The above expression for M m is symbolic. The expression represents
the following expression in which the operators are carefully orderedto avoid complications (c-numbers  etc.) resulting from reordering.
M
m h  (ln a m)q Nmq         1
                q                  q!             
 ªNm!
where the sum ranges from 0 to ∞. When M m is applied to a state it
sets the value of the mth memory location to zero.
Mm | … , n, … > =     (a m)n   | … , n, … >
                                     ªn!
       mth memory location value
   =    | … , 0, … >
The repeated applica tion of factors of N m to the state results in factors
of n.
Change the Value at Memory Location m from 0 to the Value at
Location n
Pmn  =    
(am@)Nn
            ªNn!
The above expression for P mn is also symbolic. The expression
represents the following expressi on in which the operators are
14carefully ordered to avoid compli cations (c-numbers etc.) resulting
from reordering.
      Pmn h    (ln a m@)q Nnq     1
        q         q!         ªNn!
where the sum ranges from 0 to ∞. When P mn is applied to a state it
changes the value of the mth memory location from zero to the value at
the nth memory location.
             mth        nth
Pmn | … , 0, … , x, … > =     (a m@)x   | … , 0, … , x, …>
                       ªx!
      =    | … , x, … , x, … >
The application of the factors of N n to the state results in factors of x
that lead to the above expression when summed.
The operators M m and P mn enable us to simply express the algebraic
equivalent of assembly language instructions:
LOAD m    – load the value at memory location m into the register
Prm Mr
STORE m   – store the value in the re gister at memory location m
Pmr Mm
SHIFT k     – shift the value in the register by k bits. If k is positive
the bit shift is to the right and if k is  negative the bit shift is to the left.
The bits are numbered from the leftmost bit which is bit 0corresponding to 20. The next bit is bit 1 corresponding to 21 and so
on.
If the bit shift is to the right (k > 0) then we assume the padding bits
are 0’s. For example a shift of  the bit pattern  for 7 = 1110000 … one
bit to the right is 14 = 01110000 … As a result the value in the register
is doubled (k = 1), quadrupled (k  = 2), and so on. The algebraic
expression for a k bit right shift is
 (ln a r@)q Srq              ªNr!
 q                  q!
  ªTr!
where
Sr = (2k – 1)N r  
and
Tr = 2kNr
If the bit shift is to the left (negat ive k), then we assume zero bits are
added “at ∞”. If k = -1 then the effect of left shift is to divide the value
in the register by two (dropping the fr actional part). If k = -2 then the
effect of left shift is to divide  the value in th e register by four
(dropping the fractional part) and so  on. The algebraic expression that
implements left shift is
 (ln a r)q Urq             ªNr!
 q                  q!
             ªVr!
where
Ur = N r - [2kNr ]
and
Vr = [ 2kNr ]
15with [ z ] being the value of z trunc ated to an integer (fractional part
dropped).
ADD m      – add the value at memory  location m to the value in the
register
 (ln a r@)q Nmq           ªNr!
 q                  q!
        ª(Nr + N m)!
SUBTRACT m   – subtract the value at memory location m from the
value in the register (assumes the valu e in the register is greater than or
equal to the value at location m)
 (ln a r)q Nmq           ªNr!
 q                  q!
        ª(Nr - N m)!
MULTIPLY m   – multiply the value in the register by the value at
memory location m
 (ln a r@)q (N r )q(Nm - 1)q    ªNr!
 q                      q!
      ª(Nr Nm)!
DIVIDE m   – divide the value in the register by the value at memory
location m
 (ln a r@)q W q      ªNr!
 q                q!
        ªX!
whereW = N r  - [ N r / N m ]
and
X = [ N r / N m ]
with [ z ] being the value of z trunc ated to an integer (fractional part
dropped).
AND m  – change the value in the regi ster by “and-ing” it with the
value at memory location m
 ((ln a r@)q(W)q (W) + (ln a r)q (-W)q (-W) )   ªNr!
     q                q!
             ªX!
where
W =  N r & N m - N r
and where
X = N r & N m
with (z) = 1 if z > 0 and 0 if z < 0. The & operator (adopted from the
C programming language) performs bitwise AND. Corresponding bits
in each operand are “multiplied” together using the multiplicationrules:
1 & 1 = 11 & 0 = 0 & 1 = 0 & 0 = 0
For example the binary numbers 1010 & 1100 = 1000 or in base 10 5
& 3 = 1.
OR m  – change the value in the regi ster by “or-ing” it with the value
at memory location m
16   (ln a r@)q(W)q   ªNr!
     q         q!
        ªX!
where
W =  N r | N m - N r
and where
X = N r | N m
The | operator (adopte d from the C programming language) performs
bitwise OR. Corresponding bits in  each operand are “multiplied”
together using the multiplication rules:
1 | 1 = 1 | 0 = 0 | 1 = 10 | 0 = 0
For example the binary numbers 1010 | 1100 = 1110 or in base 10 5 | 3
= 7.
NOT   – change the value in the register by “noting” it
 ((ln a r@)q(W)q (W) + (ln a r)q (-W)q(-W))     ªNr!
     q                q!
               ªX!
where
W =  ~N r - N r
and where
X = ~N r
with (z) = 1 if z > 0 and 0 if z < 0. The ~ operator (adopted from the
C programming language) performs  bitwise NOT. Each 1 bit isreplaced by a 0 bit and each 0 bit is  replaced by a 1 bit. Since we have
infinite words in our computer we  supplement this rule with the
restriction that the ex change of 1’s and 0’s only is made up to and
including the rightmost 1 bit in  the operand. The 0 bits beyond that
remain 0 bits. For example the binary number ~101 = 010 or in base10, ~3 = 2.
INPUT m   – input a value storing it at  memory location m. The input
device is usually associated with a memory location from which the
input symbolically takes place. We  will designate the memory location
of the input device as in.
P

OUTPUT m   –  output the value at memory location m. The output
device is usually associated with a memory location to which output
symbolically takes place. We w ill designate the memory location of
the output device as out.
Poutm Mout
TRA m    – set the value of the pr ogram counter to the value at
memory location m. If we designate the program counter memorylocation as pc then this  instruction is mapped to

TZR m    – set the value of the pr ogram counter to the value at
memory location m if the value in the register is zero.

using (0) = 1.
17HALT      – stop execution of the program. The halt in a program is
mapped to a “bra” state vector.

A Simple Assembly Language Program
Assembly language instructions can be combined to form an assembly
language program. Perhaps the best  way to see how the algebraic
representation of assembly language  works is to translate a simple
assembly language program into its algebraic equivalent.
The program that we will consider is:1 INPUT x
2 INPUT y3 LOAD x4 ADD y5S T O R E  z6 OUTPUT z7 HALT
This program translates to the algebraic equivalent:
     7         6             5                 4               3           2            1        Steps
< … | P outz Mout   P zr Mz    (ar@)Ny ªNr!   P rx Mr   P yin My   P xin Mx | … >
  
          ª(Nr + N y)!
where the power of ar@ is represented by a pow er series expansion as
seen earlier.
The algebraic expression in the br ackets produces one output state
from a given initial state. The valu es in memory after the last step
correspond to one and only one output state of the form:
< n, m, p,  … |  =  (N (r@)n(a0@)m (a1@)p … | 0 >)@where N is a normalization constant.
This simple program does not produce a superposition of states. As a
result programs of this type are analogous to ordinary programs for
normal, non-Quantum computers. The numbers in memory after theprogram concludes are the “output” of the program. We will seeprograms in succeeding sections that take a computer of fixed state N
(r
@)n(a0@)m (a1@)p … | 0 > and produce a superpos ition of states that must
be interpreted quantum mechanica lly. These programs are quantum in
nature and the computer that runs them must be a quantum computer.
Programs and Program Logic
The simple program of the last section corresponded to a sequential
program that executed step by ste p. We now turn to more complex
programs with program logic that supports non-sequen tial execution of
programs. When this type of progr am executes the execution of the
instructions can lead to jumps from one instruction to another
instruction in another part of the program.
Programs are linear – one instruction executes after another. But they
are not sequential – the instructions  do not always execute step by step
sequentially. A program can specify ju mps (“goto” instructions) in the
code from the current instruction to  an instruction se veral steps after
the current instruction or several st eps back to a previous instruction.
The code then executes sequentially until the next jump isencountered.
These jumps in the code at the le vel of assembly language implement
the control constructs such as go to statements, if expressions, for
loops, and switch expressions seen in higher level languages such as C
and C++.
Jumps in code can be implemented in the algebraic representation of
programs by having a program counter memory value that incrementsas the algebraic factor correspondi ng to each step executes. Steps in
18the program can execute or not ex ecute depending on the current value
of the program counter.
Changes in the program counter value are made using the TRA and
TZR instructions. In the algebrai c representation the program counter
variable can be used to manage the execution of the program steps.
The key algebraic constructs supporting non-seque ntial program
execution are:
Execute instruction only if PC [ n
( … )  ( n - N pc)
Execute instruction only if PC m n
( … )  ( Npc - n)
Execute instruction only if PC = n
( … )  ( Npc – n)
Execute instruction only if PC not equal to n
( … ) ( Npc – n) + ( n - N pc) - 2( Npc – n)
where the parentheses contain one or more instructions and where
(x) = 1 if x = 0 and zero otherwise . The function (x) can be
represented by step functions as
(x) = (x) (-x)
Using these constructs we can c onstruct non-sequential programs that
supprt “goto’s”, if’s and other contro l constructs seen in higher level
languages.To illustrate this feature of the algebraic representation we will
consider an enhancement of th e assembly language program seen
earlier:1 INPUT x2 INPUT y3 LOAD x4 TZR y5 ADD y6S T O R E  z7 OUTPUT z8 HALT
This program has the new feature th at if the first input – to memory
location x – is zero, then instruct ion 4 will cause a jump to the
instruction specified by the value stored at memory location y.
For example if the inputs are 0 pl aced at memory location x and 2
placed at memory location y, then the TZR instruction will cause the
program to jump to instruction 2 from instruction 4. Then the program
will proceed to execute from instruction 2.
Another example of a case with a jump is if the input to memory
location x is zero and the input to memory location y is 6 then the
program jumps from instruction 4 to instruction 6 and the program
completes execution from there. If the input to memory location x is
non-zero no jump takes place.
To establish the algebraic equiva lent of the preceding example we
have to use the non-sequential cons tructs provided earlier in this
section. In addition we must define the equivalent recursively because
of the possibility that the program may jump backwards to an earlier
instruction in the progr am. If only “forward” jumps were allowed then
recursion would not be needed.
An algebraic representation of the program that supports only forward
leaps is:
198             7

The program steps are numbere d above each corresponding
expression. The step function expres sions enable the jump to take
place successfully.
A program with forward and back ward jumps supported requires a
recursive definition. We will define  the recursive function f() with:
      7
f() = (apc@Poutz Mout) (Npc- 7)        6
(apc@Pzr Mz) (Npc- 6)

         1
( apc@Pxin Mx) (Npc- 1)  
The program is
f()a pc@Mpc | … >
This program is well behaved except if the input value placed at the y
memory location is 4. In this case  the program recursively executes
forever. This defect can be removed by using another memory locationfor a counter variable.
We can modify the program so that  the program only recursively calls
itself a finite number of times by having each recursive call decrease
the counter variable by one. When th e value reaches zero the recursion
terminates. An example of such a program (set to allow at most 10
iterations of the recursion) is:
20      7
g() = (apc@Poutz Mout) (Npc- 7)
                 6

The program is

where w is some memory location. We conjecture that any assembly
language program using the previous ly specified instructions can be
mapped to an algebraic represen tation – possibly with the use of
additional memory for variables su ch as the counter variable seen
above.Using the algebraic constructs supporting non-sequential program
execution we can create algebrai c representations  of assembly
language programs. These programs ha ve a definite input state and
through the execution of the program th ey evolve into a definite output
state -–not a superposition of output  states. Therefore they faithfully
represent assembly language progra ms. On the other hand they are
quantum in the sense that they use states and harmonic oscillator-like
raising and lowering operators. The types of programs we are creating
in this approach are “sharp” on th e space of states. One input state
evolves through the program’s execu tion to one and only one output
state with probability one.
These types of programs are analogous  to free field theory in which
incoming particles evolve without interaction to an output state
containing the same particles.
In the next section we extend the ideas in this section to quantum
programming where a variety of output  states are possible – each with
a certain probability of being produced.
Quantum Assembly Language™ Programs
In this section we will first look at a simplified quantum program that
illustrates quantum effects but in act uality is a sum of deterministic
assembly language programs ma pped to algebraic equivalents.
Consider a “quantum” program that  is the sum of three ordinary
programs g 1(), g 2() and g 3() of the type seen in the last section. Further
let us assume the set of orthonormal states
| n, m, p, … >
that we saw in the previous sections with
< X | Y > = XY
where XY represents a product of Kronecker  functions in the
individual values in memory of the | X > and | Y > states. Further let us
assume
21| n1, m 1, p1, … > = g 1()| … >
| n2, m 2, p2, … > = g 2()| … >
| n3, m 3, p3, … > = g 3()| … >
for some initial state of the quantum computer. Then
g1() + g2() + g3()| … >
is a “quantum” program where , , and  are constants such that
||2 + ||2 + ||2 = 1
The quantum program produces the state | n 1, m 1, p 1, … > with
probability | |2, the state | n 2, m 2, p2, … > with probability | |2, and the
state | n 3, m 3, p3, … > with probability | |2.
We now have a quantum probabilis tic computer. The programs g 1(),
g2() and g 3() are being executed in parallel  in a quantum probabilistic
manner.
Currently, the most feasible wa y of creating a Quantum Computer
with current technology or reasona ble extrapolations of current
technology is to create a material which approximates a lattice with
spins at each lattice site  that we can orient electromagnetically at the
beginning of a program. The execu tion of a program takes place by
applying electromagnetic fields that  have a time dependence specific
to the computation. The electroma gnetic fields implement a custom-
tailored set of interactions between the spins in the material thatsimulates the calculation to be performed.
The interactions are specified with some Hamiltonian or some
effective Hamiltonian and the initia l state of the la ttice spins evolves
dynamically to some configuration that is then measured.The Hamiltonians are normally sp ecified using the space-time
formalism that is a familiar part of Quantum Mechanics. AHamiltonian specifies the time evolu tion of a system starting from an
initial state. We can introduce an explicit time dependence in states by
using the notation:
| (t) >
to denote the state of a Quantum Com puter at time t. The general state
of the computer at time t can be written as a superposition of the
number representation states:
| (t) > =  f
n(t)| n 1, n2, n3, … >
     n
where n represents a set of values n 1, n2, n3, …
The time evolution of the states can  be specified using the Hamiltonian
operator H as
| (t) > =  e-iHt| (0) >
With this Hamiltonian formulation we can imagine wishing to
simulate a physical (or mathematical) process, defining a Hamiltonianthat corresponds to the process, and then creating an experimental
setup using a set of lattice spins in some material that implements the
simulation. The experimental setup will  prepare the initial state of the
spins, create a fine tuned interacti on that simulates the physics of the
process, and then, after the system has evolved, will measure the stateof the system at time t. Repeated performance of this procedure will
determine the probability distribution associated with the final state of
the Quantum Computer. The probabil ity distribution is specified by
|f
n(t)|2 as a function of the sets of numbers denoted by n.
A simple example of a Hamiltonian  that causes a Quantum Computer
to evolve in a non-trivial way is:
22        
∞
H =    am+1@ am
     m = 0
(This example was chosen partly b ecause it has a form similar to a
Virasoro algebra generator in SuperS tring Theory.) Let us assume the
initial state of the Quantum Computer at t = 0 is
| 1, 0, 0, 0, … >
that is, an initial value of 1 in th e first word in memory and zeroes in
all other memory locations. At time t the state of memory is:
nth memory location
        
∞
| (t) > =     fn(t)| 0, 0, … , 1, 0, … >
      n = 0
with
fn(t) = (-it)n/n!
using the power series expansi on of the exponentiated Hamiltonian
expression. The probability of finding the state
nth memory location
    | 0, 0, … , 1, 0, … >
is
(tn/n!)2
At first glance the Hamiltonian approach is very different from the
Quantum Assembly Language™ appr oach discussed above. However
these approaches can be interre lated in special cases and (we
conjecture) in the general case through sufficiently clevertransformations. For example, the preceding Hamiltonian can be re-
expressed as assembly language instructions
        
∞
H =  (STORE (m+1))(ADD “1”)(LOAD (m+1)) $
       m = 0
$ (STORE m) (SUBTRACT “1”)(LOAD m)
where a value is loaded into the re gister from memory location m and
then 1 is added to the value in  the register. The “1” expression
represents a literal va lue one not a memory location. The parentheses
around m+1 indicates it is the (m+1)th memory location – not the
addition of one to the value at the mth location.
The preceding assembly language expression for H can be replaced
with the algebraic representation expression:
            ∞
H =  Pm+1r Mm+1 ar@   1    P rm+1MrPmrMmarªNrPrmMr
       m = 0     ª(Nr + 1)
This complex expression is not an improvement in one sense. The
original Hamiltonian expression was much simpler. Its importance isthe mapping that it embodies from a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian
to an assembly language expression to an algebraic representation of
the assembly language.
If we regard the value in the re gister as a “scratchpad” value as
programmers often do, then we can establish a representation of a
m@
and am in terms of the algebraic representation of assembly language
instructions.
am@ h Pmr Mm ar@     1      P rm Mr
ª(Nr + 1)
and
23am  h  Pmr Mm ar ªNr Prm Mr
The power series expansion of the exponentiated Hamiltonian in the
previous example is an example of the use of Perturbation Theory. The
direct solution of a problem is of ten not feasible because of the
complexity of the dynamics. Physicists have a very well developedtheory for the approximate solution of these difficult problems calledPerturbation Theory. Perturbation Theo ry takes an exact solution of a
simplified version of the problem a nd then calculates corrections to
that solution that approximate the ex act solution of th e problem. In the
preceding example the initial st ate of the Quantum Computer
represents a time-independent desc ription of the Quantum Computer.
The time-dependent description of the Quantum Computer which isthe sought-for solution requires the evaluation of the result of the
application of the exponentiated Hamilt onian to the initial state. For a
small elapsed time, the exponential can be expanded in a power series
and the application of the first few terms of the power series to the
initial state approximates the actual  state of the Quantum Computer.
Thus we have a Perturbation Theory for the time evolution of theQuantum Computer expressed as an expansion in powers of the
elapsed time.
Bit-Level Quantum Computer Language
In the previous section we examined a Quantum Assembly
Language™ with words consisting of an  infinite sets of bits. In this
section we will examine the opposit e extreme – a Quantum Computer
Language with one-bit words. One can also create Quantum ComputerLanguages for intermediate cases such as 32-bit words.
A Bit-Level Quantum Computer Language can be represented with
anti-commuting Fermi operators b
i and b i@ for i = 0, 1, 2, …
representing each bit location in the Quantum Computer’s memorywith the anti-commutation rules:
{ b
i, bj@} = ij{ bi, bj} = 0
{ bi@, bj@} = 0
where ij is 1 if i = j and zero ot herwise. We will assume an
(unrealistic) one-bit register with a pair of raising and lowering
operators r and r@ for the register with the anti-commutation relations:
{ ri, rj@} = ij
{ ri, rj} = 0
{ ri@, rj@} = 0
The ground state of the computer is th e state with the va lues at all bit
memory locations set to zero. It is represented by the vector
| 0, 0, 0, … > h | 0 > h V
A typical state of the computer will be represented with a vector such
as
| 1, 1, 1,  … >  =  r@b0@ b1@ … | 0 >
with the first number being the va lue in the register, the second
number the value at memory locat ion 0, the third number the value at
memory location 1, and so on.
A specified Quantum Computer state evolves as a Quantum Computer
Program executes to a final comput er state. A Bit-Level Quantum
Computer Program can be represen ted as an algebraic expression in
anti-commuting raising and lowe ring operators. The approach is
similar to the approach seen earlie r in this chapter for infinite-bit
words using commuting operators.
24Basic Operators of the Bit-Level Quantum Language
The key operators that are required for the algebraic representation of
a Bit-Level Quantum Computer Language™ are:
Fetch the Value at a Memory Location (Number Operator)
Nm = b m@bm
For example,
Nm | … , 1, … > = | … , 1, … >
mth memory location value
Set the Value at Memory Location m to Zero
Mm =     (b m)Nm
The above expression for M m is symbolic. The expression represents
the following expression in which the operators are carefully orderedto avoid complications (c-numbers  etc.) resulting from reordering.
M
m h eNm ln b m  =  (ln b m)q Nmq     
                                                                                     q               q!
where the sum ranges from 0 to ∞. M m becomes
 Mm = 1 + (b m – 1)N m
using the identity N m = N m2. When M m is applied to a state it sets the
value of the mth memory location to zero.Mm | … , x, … > =    | … , 0, … >
       mth memory location value
Change the Value at Memory Location m from 0 to the Value at
Location n
Pmn  =  (b m@)Nn
The above expression for P mn is also symbolic. The expression
represents the following expressi on in which the operators are
carefully ordered to avoid compli cations (c-numbers etc.) resulting
from reordering.
      Pmn h    (ln b m@)q Nnq   
        q           q!
where the sum over q ranges from 0 to ∞. Using the identity N m = N m2
the expression for P mn simplifies to:
Pmn = 1 + (b m –1)N m
When P mn is applied to a state it changes the value of the mth memory
location from zero to the value at the nth memory location.
             mth        nth
Pmn | … , 0, … , x, … > =     (b m@)x   | … , 0, … , x, …>
   =    | … , x, … , x, … >
We can use the operators M m and P mn to express bit-wise assembly
language instructions:
25LOAD m    – load the value at memory location m into the register
Prm Mr = (1 - N r + b r)(1 - N m) + (N r + b r@)Nm
The first term on the right handles the case N m = 0 and the second term
on the right handles the case N m = 1.
STORE m   – store the value in the register at memory
location m
Pmr Mm = (1 - N m + b m)(1 - N r) + (N m + b m@)Nr
The first term on the right handles the case N r = 0 and the second term
on the right handles the case N r = 1.
ADD m      – add the value at memory location m to the
value in the register
(br@)Nm  =   (ln b r@)q Nmq
                  q              q!
= 1 + (b r@ – 1)N m
If both the register and memory b it m have values of one then the
application of this ope rator expression to th e quantum state produces
zero.
SUBTRACT m   – subtract the value at memory location m
from the value in the register
(br)Nm  =   (ln b r)q Nmq
                  q              q!= 1 + (b r – 1)N m
If the value in the register is zero and the value at location m is one the
application of this operator produces zero.
MULTIPLY m   – multiply the value in the register by the value at
memory location m
(br@)(Nm -1)Nr =  (ln b r@)q (N r )q(Nm - 1)q  
q                      q!
  
        = 1 + (b r – N r)(1 - N m)
Other assembly language instructions  can be expressed in algebraic
form as well.
The operator algebra that we have developed for a bit-wise Quantum
Assembly Language™ or a Quantu m Machine Language™ provides a
framework for the investigation of the properties of Quantum
Languages within an algebraic framew ork – a far simpler task than the
standard quantum linguistic approaches.
Quantum High Level Computer Language Programs
The Quantum Assembly Language™ representation that we have
developed earlier in this chapter forms a basis for high level Quantum
Programming Languages. These langua ges are analogous to high level
computer languages such as C or C++ or FORTRAN.
In ordinary computation a statemen t in a high level language such as
a = b + c;
26in C programming is mapped to a set of assembly language by a C
compiler. A simple mapping of th e above C statement to assembly
language would be
LOAD ab
ADD  acSTORE aa
where aa is the memory address of a,  ab is the memory address of b
and ac is the memory address of c.
If we decide to define a High Level Quantum Computer Language™
then it would be natural to define  it analogously in terms of a Quantum
Assembly Language™. A statemen t in the High Level Quantum
Computer Language™ would map to  a set of Quantum Assembly
Language™ instructions.
For example, a = b + c would map to the algebraic expression
P
aar Maa   (ar@)Nac       ªNr!     P rab Mr
ª(Nr + N ac)!
using the formalism developed earlie r in this chapter to LOAD, ADD
and STORE.
The definition of high level Quan tum Computer Languages™ in this
approach is straightforward. One can then imagine creating programs
in these languages for execution on Quantum Computers just as
ordinary programs are created for ordinary computers.
Another approach to higher leve l Quantum Computer Languages™ is
to simply express them directly us ing raising and lowering operators –
not in terms of Quantum Assembly Language™ instructions. Forexample the preceding a = b + c; stat ement can be directly expressed
as(a
aa@)Nac+Nab (aaa)Naa                1      
ª(Nac + N ab)! ªNaa!
Simple High Level Quantum Comput er programs can be expressed as
products of algebraic expressions  embodying the statements of the
program. These programs are sharp on the set of memory states takingan initial memory state that is an  eigenstate of the set of number
operators N
m into an output eigenstate of the number operators.
A general High Level Quantum Comput er Program is a sum of simple
High Level Programs. For example,
h1() + h2() + h3()| … >
where , , and  are constants such that
||2 + ||2 + ||2 = 1
The sum of simple programs h1() + h2() + h3() produces the state |
n1, m 1, p1, … > with probability | |2, the state | n 2, m 2, p2, … > with
probability | |2, and the state | n 3, m 3, p3, … > with probability | |2.
 An initial eigenstate of the numbe r operators is tranformed into an
output state that is a superpositi on of number operator eigenstates. In
this case we use probabilities to specify the likelihood that a given
output eigenstate will be found when the output state is measured.
A Hamiltonian can also be used to  specify the time evolution of a
system starting from an initial state. Using the notation:
| (t) >
to denote the state of a Quantum Com puter at time t the general state
of a computer at time t can be wri tten as a superposition of  number
representation states:
    | (t) > =  fn(t)| n 1, n2, n3, … >
         n
27where n represents a set of values n 1, n2, n3, …
The time evolution of the states can  be specified using the Hamiltonian
operator H as
| (t) > =  e-iHt| (0) >
A simple example of a Hamiltonian  that causes a Quantum Computer
to evolve in a non-trivial way is:
   
∞
H =         (am+2@)Nm+1+Nm  (am+2)Nm+2         1
m = 0                                
ª(Nm+1+N m)! ªNm+2!
This Hamiltonian is based on the a = b + c statement above. This
Hamiltonian generates a complex s uperposition of states as time
evolves. More complex Hamiltoni ans equivalent to programs with
several statements can be easily constructed.
Quantum C Language™
One of the most important comput er languages is the C programming
language developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1970’s. The original
version of version of the C language was a remarkable combination of
low level (assembly language-like) features and high level features
like the mathematical parts of FORTRAN. The variables in thelanguage were integers stored in wo rds just as we saw in the earlier
examples in this chapter. (There were several other types of integers aswell – a complication that we will ignore.)
Using the ideas seen in the earlier sections of this chapter it is easy to
develop algebraic equivalents for mo st of the constructs of the C
language and thus create a Quantum C Language™. An importantelement that must be added to the previous development is tointroduce the equivalent of pointers. Simply put  pointers are variables
that have the addresses of memory  locations as their values. The C
language has two important operato rs for pointer manipulations:Operator Role Example
    & Fetch an address ptr = &x;
    *                       Fetch/set the value at an address z = *ptr;
*ptr = 99;
The & operator of C fetches the addr ess of a variable in memory. The
example shows a pointer variable pt r being set equal to the address of
the x variable. The * (dereferencing) operator can fetch the value at a
memory location. The first * exam ple illustrates this aspect: the
variable z is set equal to the value at the memory location specified bythe pointer variable ptr. The * opera tor can also be used to set the
value at a memory location as illu strated by the second * example. In
this example the value 99 is placed  at the memory location (address)
specified by the ptr pointer variable.
These operators can be implemented in the algebraic representation of
the Quantum C Language™ in the following way:
&w [A, ]
where A =  m(a
m  - am@) with the sum from 0 to ∞. If we apply the
operator to a raising or lowering operator we obtain its address 
& am@= [A, am@] = m = &  am= [A, am]
The equivalent of the * operator is actually a pair of operator
expressions. To fetch the value at a memory location we use
*m h Nm
To set the value to X at a memory  location m we use a more complex
C language representation:
*m = X;
28An equivalent alge braic expression is:
*m(X) h (am@)X  (am)Nm            1
                 ªX! ªNm!
*m(X) is a functional notation. So a = b + c can be rewritten as a
“pointer” algebraic expression as:
          (a aa@)*ac + *ab (aaa)*aa                  1              
ª(*ac + *ab)! ª*aa!
Or more compactly using the functional notation as
      *aa(*ab + *ac)
The Quantum C Language™ could be used to define Hamiltonians for
a Quantum Computer. Other languages  such as Java™, C++, lisp and
so on also have Quantum analogues wh ich may be defined in a similar
way.

Abstract
We discuss foundation of quantum mechanics (interpretatio ns, su-
perposition, principle of complementarity, locality, hid den variables)
and quantum information theory.
keywords: Foundations, contextual probability, quantum inform ation,
quantum parallelism, nonlocality
1 INTRODUCTION
In this paper there will be discussed foundations of quantum mecha nics in
connection to quantum information theory. Such a discussion is ver y impor-
tant, since intensive development of models of quantum computing, cryp-
tography and teleportation as well as general quantum informatio n theory
induced large interest to the very foundations of quantum theory . Many
questions that have been of only theoretical (or even only philosop hic) value
for many years now play a fundamental role in applied and even techn ologi-
cal investigations. For example, security of quantum cryptograp hic schemes
and, consequently, prices of corresponding market products an d technologies
1
depend crucially on such general quantum problems as complementary and
nonlocality.
We can speak about renaissance in the study of foundations of qua ntum
theory.
And this renaissance in quantum foundations was prepared by quan tum
information theory, see e.g. [1], where more than 50 talks were pres ented at
section ”Shannon meets Bohr”.
In the plenary talk of K.A. Valeev at the present conference there was
given a list of fundamental features of quantum mechanics (QM) th at are
very important for quantum computing (as well as cryptography, and tele-
portation).
I would like to present a similar list of distinguishing features of QM and
discuss roles that thosefeatures play inour understanding ofqua ntum reality
and, in particular, quantum information theory. Formally K.A. Valeev and I
discuss the same class of problems. However, our viewpoints to the se prob-
lems are quite diﬀerent. K.A. Valeev presented the conventional vie wpoint
to foundations of QM. From the conventional point of view all funda mental
problems of QM (besides the problem of measurement) are already s olved.
For quantum computing (as well as cryptography and teleportatio n) this
means that from the theoretical point of view this theory is well est ablished.
There are only experimental and technological problems. I do not t hink so!
In this paper, see also [2], I shall present nonconventional views to foun-
dations of QM and consider some consequences for quantum inform ation
theory. I start with the list of distinguishing features of QM:
(S) This is a statistical theory of measurement.
(D) Discreteness of some fundamental physical variables.
(C) Principle of complementarity.
(NL) Nonlocality.
2 CONVENTIONAL INTERPRETATION
Westartwith(S).IthinkthateverybodywouldagreethatQMisafo rmalism
thatdescribes statistical propertiesoflargeensembles ofvery s pecial physical
systems, so called quantum systems. QM could not say anything deﬁ nite
aboutbehaviour ofindividual quantumsystems. Inquantumforma lismthere
is nothing about trajectories of individual quantum systems. We st ill do not
know anything about dynamics of individual electrons in atom and so o n.
2
N. Bohr rightly pointed out that quantum formalism is not about quan tum
physical systems, but about our measurements on such systems . We can
formulate this principle as Principle of contextuality. As a consequence
ofthisprinciple, wehavetotakeintoaccount thewholephysical arr angement
of an experiment.
We continue to discuss (S). As a consequence of (S), it seems to be natu-
ral to assume that a quantum state should describe statistical pr operties of
an ensemble of physical systems that were prepared under the sa me complex
of physical conditions, physical context. However, by the conventional
(orthodox Copenhagen) interpretation of QM a wave function pro videsthe
complete description of an individual quantum system . Such a view-
point, i.e., coupling of a wave function to an individual quantum system ,
induces hard problems in foundations of QM. One of them is the well kn own
problem of measurement , see e.g. [3].
Another (less known, but not less important) problem is the problem
of the origin of quantum randomness. By using the conventional interpre-
tation of QM we could not apply the conventional ensemble approach to
probability theory, see e.g. [4], [2]. Typically there are used such word s as
“irreducible quantum randomness”, see e.g. [4]. However, such irre ducible
randomness could not be explained by using conventional probability the-
ory (Kolmogorov, 1933). Typically it is said that conventional proba bility
theory does not work in quantum physics. We should use a new quant um
calculus of probabilities based on linear algebra in the Hilbert space of q uan-
tum states. In fact such a viewpoint is strongly supported by very strange
(nonconventional) behaviour of quantum probabilities. It is well kno wn that
the classical rule for the addition of probabilities of alternatives:
P=P1+P2 (1)
does not work in experiments with elementary particles. Instead of this rule,
we have to use quantum rule:
P=P1+P2+2/radicalBig
P1P2cosθ. (2)
The classical rule for the addition of probabilities of alternatives is pe rturbed
by so called interference term.
Nevertheless, many famous physicists did not want to follow to the c on-
ventional (Copenhagen) interpretation of quantum mechanics. I n particu-
lar, A. Einstein supported the ensemble viewpoint to a quantum stat e. He
3
wanted to preserve the conventional ensemble viewpoint even for quantum
probabilities. The origin of his views can be easily explained. In fact, in t heir
pioneer papers M. Planck and A. Einstein used methods of classical s tatis-
tical mechanics (in particular, conventional probability theory) to describe
black body radiation andphotoelectric eﬀect. The only modiﬁcation of clas-
sical statistical mechanics was due to the recognition of the princip le (D) for
the momentum variable. In some sense it was nothing than comeback to the
purelycorpuscular modeloflight(developed, forexample, byNewt on). How-
ever, a little bit later the purely corpuscular viewpoint to quantum sy stems
became inconsistent with statistical data obtained in diﬀraction and inter-
ference experiments. This statistical data followed to quantum probabilistic
rule (2) and not to conventional probabilistic rule (1).
To resolve this paradox between purely corpuscular behaviour of q uan-
tum systems in some experiments andpurely wave behaviour in other experi-
ments, N. Bohr proposed the principle of complementarity , (C). By (C) there
exists incompatible complexes of experimental physical conditions ( contexts)
determiningincompatiblephysical observables, e.g. positionandmom entum.
We remark that very often (C) is identiﬁed with Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle. Of course, it is well known that N. Bohr proposed principle ( C)
after numerous discussions with W. Heisenberg on his uncertainty p rinci-
ple. However, (C) is essentially wider than Heisenberg’s principle of mu tual
perturbations inducing incompatible observables.
We remark that fathers of the orthodox Copenhagen interpreta tion of
QM from the very beginning were strongly against the possibility to re duce
quantum randomness to classical randomness. From the beginning it was
claimed that it is even in principle impossible to create a kind of determin-
istic (classical-like) model that would reproduce quantum probabilitie s via
e.g. uncertainty in initial conditions and other parameters. W. Heise nberg
claimed this already in 1926 directly after the publication of his ﬁrst pa per
on noncommutative representation of quantum of observables. S uch a view-
point was supported by N. Bohr in his discussions with A. Einstein on th e
EPR paradox. It was the conventional viewpoint that quantum mec hanics is
complete and it would be impossible to provide ﬁner description of physical
reality.
As we know at present time, such a viewpoint was not justiﬁed. Ther e
exist classical-like models reproducing quantum probabilities. We can m en-
tion e.g. Bohmian mechanics andstochastic electrodynamics. Of course,
these models are not free of problems. However, I do not think tha t any of
4
these problems is essentially harder than e.g. the problem of measur ement
in the conventional Copenhagen approach. I think that immediate r ejec-
tion of classical like prequantum models is merely a consequence of ge neral
prejudice against such models. For example, Bohmian mechanics is ty pi-
cally criticized for its nonlocality. However, at the same time it is widely
accepted that conventional QM is nonlocal. Moreover, people tota lly forgot
that Bell’s arguments that nowadays are used to support quantum nonlocal-
ity were originally proposed to support Bohmian mechanics. In fact, J. Bell
was against locality and not against realism. Realism in the EPR-Bohm
experiment (and, as a consequence, the possibility of deterministic descrip-
tion) was from the beginning evident for J. Bell as the direct conseq uence
of the precise anticorrelations. J. Bell wanted to prove nonlocality of any
deterministic prequantum model.1
3 CONTEXTUAL ENSEMBLEINTERPRE-
TATION
In the series of papers [5]-[7] I develop contextual probabilistic approach to
QM. One of the main distinguishing features of this approach is demysti-
ﬁcationof quantum probabilities and, as a consequence, the whole QM. I
started with (S) – understanding of the fact that QM is just a spec ial the-
ory of statistical measurements. Then I tried to ﬁnd a condition th at would
specify this theory of statistical measurements among all possible theories of
statistical measurements. In particular, such a condition should d istinguish
QM and classical statistical mechanics (both considered as theorie s of sta-
tistical measurements). Moreover, there should be a kind of corr espondence
principle that would establish transition from quantum statistics to c lassical
statistics. The fundamental postulate of our model is the following one:
“Probabilities for all physical observables depend on comp lexes
of experimental conditions under that measurements of obse rvables
are performed.”
We call this principle “principle of contextual probabilities.” This prin-
ciple of contextual probabilities is closely related to Bohr’s principle of con-
textuality. However, there is very important diﬀerence between t hose two
1I would like to thank Shelly Goldstein who explained to me Bell’s views to rea lity and
locality.
5
principles. Bohr’s principle is a principle of individual contextuality. The
basic notion related to Bohr’s principle of contextuality is the notion o f
individual physical phenomenon. Such a phenomenon is determined by a
complex of experimental physical conditions. My principle is a principle of
statistical contextuality. The basic notion related to my principle is the no-
tion of contextual probability. Let us consider the two slit experime nt, see
also further derivation of quantum probabilistic rule (2). For N. Boh r it is
important that each individual spot on the registration screen dep ends on
the whole experimental arrangement (e.g. both slits are open or on ly one of
them). For me it is important that the probability distribution of spot s on
the registration screen depends on the whole experimental arran gement. Of
course, the reader could argue that there is not so much diﬀerenc e between
individual and statistical contextuality. However, the situation is n ot so sim-
ple. Roughly speaking Bohr’s individual contextuality does not imply th at
probability spaces used in quantum theory should depend on complex es of
experimental conditions. Under Bohr’s assumption on individual con textu-
ality it is still possible (at least in principle) to consider physical observ ables
as random variables on one ﬁxed probability spaces: various complex es of
physical conditions just determine various physical observables. In particu-
lar, after 75 years of Bohr’s individual contextualism it was still uncle ar why
quantum probabilities follow to rules induced by the Hilbert space stru cture
and not by the structure of conventional probability theory.
In papers [5]-[7] it was demonstrated (and it was surprising even for me)
that starting with only the principle of contextual probabilities we ca n derive
quantum probabilistic rule (2). In its general form(2) is quantum ge neraliza-
tionofthe well known formula of totalprobability. We discuss theco ntextual
probabilistic interpretation of (2) on the basis of the well known two slit ex-
periment.
In the two slit experiment rule (2) is induced by combining of statistica l
data obtained in three diﬀerent experiments: both slits are open; o nlyjth
slit is open, j= 1,2.The main distinguishing feature of statistical data ob-
tained in these three experiments in the following one. By combining by (1)
data obtained in experiments in that only one of slits is open we do not g et
the probability distribution for data obtained in the experiment in tha t both
slits are open. On the other hand we never observe a particle that p asses
through both slits simultaneously - it would be observed passing the ﬁ rst or
second slit. There is no the direct observation of particle splitting. A s each
particle passes only one of slits, we have the standard case of alter natives.
6
Thus we should use conventional rule (1) for the addition of probab ilities of
alternatives. This disagreement between experimental statistica l data and
the rule of conventional probability theory looks as a kind of parado x. The
traditional solution of this paradox is the use of the wave model for elemen-
tary particles and, as a consequence, the principle of complementa rity. We
now perform detailed contextual analysis for the two slits experime nt. We
consider the following complexes of physical conditions, contexts.
S=both slits are open, Sj=only jth slit is open, j= 1,2.
In fact, probabilities in (2) are related to these three contexts. T hus
P=PS(E) andPj=PS→SjPSj(E),j= 1,2.Here we use various context-
indexes. The PS(E),PSj(E) denote probabilities of an event Ewith respect
to various contexts. The coeﬃcients PS→Sj,j= 1,2,have another mean-
ing. In general these are not probabilities of contexts Sjwith respect to
the context S(besides some very special, “classical”, situations), because
the context Sjin general is not an event for the context S.In general we
could not consider a complex of physical conditions Sjas an event in the
probabilistic space induced by some ﬁxed context S.
The coeﬃcients PS→Sj,j= 1,2,are kinds of splitting coeﬃcients . To
be more precise, we consider some ﬁxed source of particles and som e ﬁxed
periodTduring that we collect particles arriving to the registration screen.
We consider an ensemble Ethat consists of all particles that are collected
on the registration screen during the period T,when both slits are open.
An ensemble Ejconsists of all particles that are collected on the registration
screen during the period T,when only jth slit is open. Suppose that E
contains Nparticles and Ejcontains Njparticles. Then splitting coeﬃcients:
PS→Sj≈Nj
N, (3)
see [5] for the details. Here we use the symbol ≈,since numbers NandNj
vary from one run (of duration T) to other run (of the same duration). But
ifN→ ∞,then ﬂuctuations are negligibly small.
We remark (and it is important for our further considerations) tha t we
have the following statistical alternative condition:
PS→S1+PS→S2= 1. (4)
The statistical alternative condition has the following meaning: the t otal
number of particles that arrive to the registration screen when bo th slits are
7
open equals (in the average) to the sum of corresponding numbers when only
one of the slits is open. So by closing e.g. the ﬁrst slit we do not change the
number of particles that pass the second slit (in the average). In f act, (4)
gives the right description of alternative-situation in the two slit exp eriment.
It is not related to alternative passing of slits by a particle in the expe riment
when both slits are open. This equation describes alternative sharin g of
particles between two preparation procedures: jth slit is open, j= 1,2.
However, the splitting coeﬃcients PS→Sjwould not play so important role in
ourconsiderations. Thecrucial rolewill beplayed by contextual pr obabilities
PS(E),PSj(E).
The conventional probability theory says that, in fact, we should h ave:
P(E) =P(S1)P(E/S1)+P(S2)P(E/S2). (5)
There is assumed that complexes of physical conditions S1andS2could be
considered as events with respect to probability space containing Eas an
event and
S1∩S2=∅andS1∪S2=S.
This is the well known formula of total probability. In many considerations
(including works of fathers of quantum mechanics, see e.g. P. Dirac and
also R. Feynman) people set P=P(E) andPj=P(S1)P(E/S1).Finally,
they get the contradiction between conventional probabilistic rule (1) (that
in fact coincides with (5)) and statistical data obtained in the interf erence
experiments and described by quantum rule (2).
We would like to discuss physical and mathematical assumptions used in
the conventional derivation of (5). The main physical assumption is that this
formula is derived for one ﬁxed context S- in the mathematical formalism
- forone ﬁxed Kolmogorov probability space ; see my book [2] on extended
discussions on the role of the choice of Kolmogorov’s probability spac e in
quantum measurements. To be precise, we have to write the conve ntional
formula of total probability as
PS(E) =PS(S1)PS(E/S1)+PS(S2)PS(E/S2), (6)
taking into account that all probabilities are computed with respect to the
same complex of physical conditions S.
As we have already remarked, in Kolmogorov probability theory it is als o
important that contexts S1,S2can be realized as elements of the ﬁeld of
8
events corresponding to the context S.Thus we would get the contradic-
tion between classical rule (1) and quantum rule (2) only if we assume that
splitting coeﬃcients PS→Sjcan be interpreted as PS-probabilities, PS→Sj=
PS(Sj) and contextual probabilities PSj(E) as conditional probabilities with
respect to the context S,PSj(E) =PS(E/Sj).Here the conditional probabil-
ities are given by Bayes’ formula (the additional postulate of Kolmog orov’s
probability theory): PSj(E) =PS(E∩Sj)/PS(Sj).
But in general there are no reasons to assume that new complexes of
conditions Sjare “so nice” that new probability distributions are given by
the Bayes’ formula. Thus, in general, the formula of total probab ility can
be violated when we combine statistical data obtained for a few distin ct
contexts. In particular, it is not surprising that this formula does n ot hold
true in statistical experiments with elementary particles, where th e right
hand side of this formula is perturbed by the interference term.
The following simple considerations give the derivation of quantum pro b-
abilistic transformation (2) in the classical probabilistic framework. LetS
andSj,j= 1,2,be three diﬀerent complexes of physical conditions. We
consider the transformation of probabilities induced by transitions from one
complex of conditions to others:
S → S 1andS → S 2. (7)
We start with introducing of splitting coeﬃcients, PS→Sj.These are propor-
tionalcoeﬃcientsfornumbersofphysical systems obtainedafte rpreparations
under the complexes of physical conditions SandSj.If (starting with the
same number of particles radiated by some ﬁxed source) we get NandNj
systems after SandSjpreparations, respectively, then PS→Sjare deﬁned
by (3). We assume that splitting coeﬃcients satisfy to statistical a lternative
equation (4). This is quite natural conditions: splitting (7) of the co ntext
Sinduces just sharing of physical systems produced by a source. W e have
already discussed this sharing in the two slit experiment. The same sit uation
we have inneutron interferometry forsharing of particles coming t odetectors
when both paths are open and when just one of the paths is open.
Weintroducethe measure of statistical perturbations δinducedbycontext
transitions:
δ(S → S j;E) =PS→S1[PS(E)−PS1(E)]+PS→S2[PS(E)−PS2(E)].
9
This quantity describes the deformation of probability distribution PSdue
to context transitions. By using statistical alternative equation ( 4) we get:
PS(E) =PS(E)PS→S1+PS(E)PS→S2.
Thus we get:
PS(E) =PS→S1PS1(E)+PS→S2PS2(E)+δ(S → S j;E).(8)
Transformation (8) is the most general form of probabilistic trans formations
that can be induced by context transitions. We can formulate a kind ofcor-
respondence principle connecting context unstable and context stable (“clas-
sical”) transformations of probabilities:
IfSj→ S,j= 1,2,i.e.,δ(S → S j;E)→0, then contextual probabilistic
transformation (8) coincides (in the limit) with the conventional for mula of
total probability.
The perturbation term δ(S → S j;E) depends on absolute magnitudes of
probabilities. It would be natural to introduce normalized coeﬃcient of the
context transition
λ(S → S j;E) =δ(S → S j;E)

PS(E) =/summationdisplay
j=1,2PS→SjPSj(E)+2/radicalBig
PS→S1PS1(E)PS→S2PS2(E)λ(S → S j;E).
(9)
In fact, there are two possibilities:
1).|λ(S → S j;E)| ≤1;
2).|λ(S → S j;E)| ≥1.
In both cases it is convenient to introduce a new context transition pa-
rameterθ=θ(S → S j;E) and represent the context transition coeﬃcient in
the form:
λ(S → S j;E) = cosθ(S → S j;E),θ∈[0,π];
and
λ(S → S j;E) =±coshθ(S → S j;E),θ∈[0,∞),
respectively.
10
We introduced a “phase parameter” θby purely mathematical reasons:
to get a linear representation of probabilistic transformations indu ced by
context transitions, see section 4. However, in some experiments it could
occur that such a probabilistic parameter θhas some geometric meaning.
This induces the illusion of a wave associated with a particle. However, in
ourcontextual probabilisticframeworkthisisjustawaveofproba bility. Such
a “wave” is associated not with an individual particle, but with an ense mble
of particles (in fact, with a transition from one ensemble to another ).
We have two types of probabilistic transformations induced by the t ran-
sition from one complex of conditions to another:
PS(E) =/summationdisplay
j=1,2PS→SjPSj(E)+2/radicalBig
PS→S1PS1(E)PS→S2PS2(E)cosθ(S → S j;E).

(11)
Wederived quantum probabilisticrule(2)intheclassical probabilisticf rame-
work (in particular, without any reference to superposition of sta tes) by tak-
ing into account context dependence of probabilities.
Relatively large statistical deviations are described by transforma tion
(11). Such transformations do not appear in the conventional fo rmalism
of quantum mechanics. In principle, they could be described by so ca lled
hyperbolic quantum mechanics , [5].
Conclusion. For each ﬁxed context (experimental arrangement), we
have CLASSICAL STATISTICS. CONTEXT TRANSITION induces inter -
ference perturbation of the conventional rule for the addition of probabilistic
alternatives.
4 LINEAR ALGEBRA FOR PROBABILI-
TIES
One of the main distinguishing features of quantum theory is the Hilbe rt
space calculus for probabilistic amplitudes. As we have already discus sed,
this calculus is typically associated with wavelike (superposition) feat ures
of quantum particles. We shall show that, in fact, the Hilbert space repre-
sentation of probabilities was merely a mathematical discovery. Of c ourse,
11
this discovery simpliﬁes essentially probabilistic calculations. However , this
is pure mathematics; physics is related merely to the derivation of qu antum
interference rule (2).
The crucial point was the derivation (at the beginning purely experi-
mental) of transformation (2) connecting probabilities with respec t to three
diﬀerent contexts. In fact, linear algebra can be easily derived fro m this
transformation. Everybody familiar with the elementary geometry will see
that (2) just the well known cos-theorem. This is the rule to ﬁnd th e third
sideinatriangleifweknowlengthsoftwoothersidesandtheangle θbetween
them:
c2=a2+b2−2abcosθ .
or if we want to have ”+” before cos we use so called parallelogram law:
c2=a2+b2+2abcosθ . (12)
Herecis the diagonal of the parallelogram with sides aandband the angle θ
between these sides. Of course, the parallelogram law is just the law of linear
(two dimensional Hilbert space) algebra: for ﬁnding the length cof the sum
cof vectors aandbhaving lengths aandband the angle θbetween them.
We also can introduce complex waves by using the following elementary
formula:
a2+b2+2abcosθ=|a+beiθ|2. (13)
Thus the context transitions S → S jcan be described by the wave of prob-
ability:
ϕ=/radicalBig
PS→S1PS1(E)+/radicalBig
PS→S2PS2(E)eiθ(S→Sj;E).
5 CONTEXTUAL PROBABILISTICDERIVA-
TION OF THE SUPERPOSITION PRIN-
CIPLE IN THE TWOSLITEXPERIMENT
We shall study in more details the possibility of contextual (purely cla ssical)
derivation of the superposition principle for complex probability amplit udes,
‘waves’, in the two slit experiment. We consider one dimensional model. It
could be obtained by considering the distribution of particles on one ﬁ xed
straight line, very thin strip. It is supposed that the source of par ticles is
symmetric with respect to slits and the straight line (on the registra tion
12
screen) pass through the center of the screen. This geometry im plies that
coeﬃcients PS→Sj= 1/2,j= 1,2.By the symbol Ex,x∈R,is denoted the
event of the registration of a particle at the point xof the straight line. We
set:p(x) =PS(Ex) andpj(x) =PSj(Ex),j= 1,2.These are probabilities
that a particle would arrive to the point x(of the registration screen) under
the complexes of physical conditions SandSj,respectively. By using (10)
we get:
p(x) =1
2[p1(x)+p2(x)+2/radicalBig
p1(x)p2(x)cosθ(x)].
This is just the special case of the general transformation of pro babilities
induced by context-transitions. By using (13) we represent this p robability
as the square of a complex amplitude, p(x) =|φ(x)|2,where
φ(x) =1√
2(eiθ1(x)/radicalBig
p1(x)+eiθ2(x)/radicalBig
p2(x)) (14)
and probabilistic phases θj(x) are chosen in such a way that the phase shift
θ1(x)−θ2(x) =θ(x).We also introduce complex amplitudes for probabil-
itiespj(x) :φj(x) =1√
2eiθj(x)/radicalBig
pj(x).Herepj(x) =|φj(x)|2.The complex
amplitudes are said to be wave functions: φ(x) is the wave function on (the
straight line of) the registration screen for both slits are open; φj(x) is the
wave function on (the straight line of) the registration screen for jth slit is
open.
Let us set ξ(x) =θ(x)
h,whereh >0 is some scaling factor. We have:
φ(x) =1√
2(eiξ1(x)
h/radicalBig
p1(x)+eiξ2(x)
h/radicalBig
p2(x)) andφj(x) =1√
2eiξj(x)
h/radicalBig
pj(x).
By choosing has the Planck constant we get a quantum-like representation
of probabilities. We recall that we did not use any kind of wave argume nts.
Superposition rule (14) was obtained in purely classical probabilistic ( but
contextual!) framework.
Suppose now that ξdepends linearly on x:ξj(x) =pjx
h,ξ(x) =px
h,p=
p1−p2.Under such an assumption we shall get interference of two ‘free-
waves’ corresponding to momentums p1andp2.Of course, this linearity
could not be extracted from our general probabilistic consideratio ns. This is
a consequence of the concrete geometry of the experiment.
We underline that we did not have in mind to create some alternative
to the standard calculus of probabilities in Hilbert space. Our aim was
13
demystiﬁcation of this calculus. We demonstrated that we could use the
conventional ensemble viewpoint to probability (as it was proposed b y A.
Einstein) even in experiments with quantum systems. However, we s hould
not forget about the fundamental principle of contextual proba bilities.
Finally, we remark that starting with this principle we obtain not only
the standard trigonometric cos-like interference, but also hyper bolic cosh-
like interference, see [5] for the details. The latter calculus of (hyp erbolic)
probabilities could be realized (parallely to the standard quantum calc ulus)
in the so called hyperbolic Hilbert space, see [5]. Another way to get a lin ear
representation for the hyperbolic probabilistic transformation () is to use
the formalism of Positive Operator Valued Measures, see e.g. [8]. Thu s we
can say that starting with very natural and clear postulate on con textual
probabilities we can get the well known POVM-calculus, [9].
However, the reader can say:
“Well, QM was demystiﬁed, by using contextual probabilities. But, ﬁ-
nally, you reproduced the standard probabilistic calculus in the Hilber t space
(in its generalized POVM-form). Could you present some practical c onse-
quences of your contextual reduction to conventional probabilit y theory?”
This question will be discussed in the next section.
6 CONTEXTUAL VIEWPOINTTO QUAN-
TUM INFORMATION
What is the main diﬀerence between orthodox Copenhagen interpre tation of
QM and contextual interpretation (V¨ axj¨ o interpretation, [10]) ?
By the Copenhagen interpretation the origin of the very special qu antum
statisticsisintheveryspecialbehaviourofsocalledquantumsyste ms. Herea
wave function describes an individual system. Superposition is supe rposition
of states for an individual system.
By the V¨ axj¨ o interpretation the origin of the very special quant um statis-
tics is in the very special complexes of physical conditions that are u sed to
prepare ensembles of physical systems. Here a wave function (as it was
claimed by Einstein) describes not an individual physical system, but an en-
semble prepared under some complex of physical conditions. Super position
is not an individual property. It is related to statistical superposit ion in an
ensemble. This is superposition of complexes of physical conditions.
14
The main fundamental consequence of the V¨ axj¨ o interpretatio n for quan-
tum computing is that macroscopic classical physical systems could in princi-
pleexhibit quantum probabilistic behaviour under special complexes o fphys-
icalconditions-specialpreparationproceduresforensembles of suchsystems.
In particular, the statistical superposition property could be indu ced by en-
sembles of macroscopic classical physical systems. Thus so called quantum
parallelism of computations could be realized by ensembles of macroscopic
classical physical systems.
Of course, the V¨ axj¨ o viewpoint to quantum parallelism diﬀers cruc ially
from the Copenhagen viewpoint. By the Copenhagen interpretatio n after
the act of quantum computation (unitary evolution) the quantum s tate of
an individual physical system contains all possible values of a Boolean func-
tionfunder computation. By the V¨ axj¨ o interpretation all possible valu es
offcould be computed by performing computations over a large statist ical
ensemble of physical system. By the V¨ axj¨ o interpretation the o rigin of the
huge computational power of quantum computers is not in quantum par-
allelism, but it is a consequence of the possibility to prepare ensembles of
physical systems such that some ﬁxed value of some parameter sh ould be
realized with probability that is close to probability 1. Therefore ther e is
nothing mysterious that such a preparation could be in principle realiz ed for
macroscopic classical systems.
Our main prediction for quantum computing is the possibility to create
macroscopic classical quantum computer.
Remark. The combination “classical quantum” looks asnonsense. How-
ever, we recall that here quantum is related only to special probab ilistic
behaviour of ensembles physical systems.
At the moment we could not present any concrete model of such a c las-
sical/quantum computer. However, we underline that quantum pro babilistic
behaviour couldbefoundinvariousprocesses involving macroscopic systems,
e.g. in economy.
Another consequence of the V¨ axj¨ o interpretation is the possib ility to re-
duce quantum randomness to conventional ensemble randomness . This sup-
ports the original Einstein’s viewpoint that QM is not complete and som e
ﬁner description of physical reality is in principle possible.
Finally, we remark that the contextual probabilistic approach to Be ll’s
inequality [2], [11]-[13], demonstrated that there is no contradiction b etween
the local realist description and violation of Bell’s inequality by correlat ions
calculatedforspecialensemblesofphysical systems(quantumsy stems). Con-
15
textualprobabilisticanalysisofBell’sargumentinducednewinequalitie sthat
are not violated by quantum correlations, see [12], [13].
So if we followto the V¨ axj¨ o interpretation ofQMthe problem ofqua ntum
nonlocality is still open! Of course, our arguments [2], [11]-[13], could n ot be
considered as arguments against nonlocality. It may be that QM is no nlocal!
However, from the contextual probabilistic viewpoint Bell’s argumen ts did
no prove nonlocality of QM. There should be found some other argum ents.
Our contextual viewpoint to quantum nonlocality has important con se-
quences for quantum cryptography - the only quantum informatio n scheme
that (at the moment) is well developed for real applications. The po ssibil-
ity to represent in principle quantum correlations by classical proba bilistic
integrals induces some doubts in security of modern quantum inform ation
schemes.
Suppose that the classical reduction for quantum correlations wo uld be
possible. Then the only special source of security of quantum cryp tographic
schemes would be high (classical) sensibility of quantum systems to ex ternal
perturbations.

Abstract
We give a short overview over recent developments on quantum graphs and outline the connection
between general quantum graphs and so-called quantum rando m walks.
1 Introduction
The study of quantum mechanics on graphs has become an importan t tool for investigating the inﬂuence
of classical dynamics on spectra, wavefunctions and transport p roperties of quantum systems. Quantum
networks have been used with great success to model quantum ph enomena observed in disordered metals
and mesoscopic systems (Chalker and Coddington 1988); typical b ehaviour found in diﬀusive systems
such as localisation - delocalisation transitions (Freche et al1999), transport properties (Pascaud and
Montambaux 1999) and quantum spectral statistics (Klesse and M etzler 1997) have been studied on
graphs in the limit of inﬁnite network size. Kottos and Smilansky (1997 , 1999) looked at quantum graph
modelsforgeneral, non-diﬀusivegraphs; thisapproachwasmotiva tedby tryingtounderstandthe validity
of the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit (BGS) conjecture (Bohigas et al1984) in terms of periodic orbit trace
formula. The conjecture relates the properties of the classical d ynamics of a systems to the spectral
statistics of its quantum counterpart and states that for chaot ic systems the statistics depends only on
the symmetries of the problem and follows random matrix theory (RM T) otherwise.
Making use of the fact that periodic orbit trace formula are exact o n quantum graphs and that there
are only a ﬁnite number of diﬀerent length scales on a ﬁnite graph, a s eries of remarkable results have
been obtained over the last couple of years. A closed form quantisa tion conditions in terms of periodic
orbits has been given by Bl¨ umel et al(2002); Barra and Gaspard (2000) derived an integral expressio n
for the level spacing distribution starting form the periodic orbit tr ace formula. Furthermore, Schanz and
Smilansky (2000) described localisation on one-dimensional chains in t erms of combinatorial expression
using periodic orbits. The most far reaching development is maybe du e to Berkolaiko et al(2002,2003),
who, inspired by work from Sieber (2002) and Sieber and Richter (20 01), derived next to leading oder
termsfortheformfactor. Extensionstoallordershavebeengiv enbyM¨ uller et al. (2004). Gapconditions
given by Tanner (2001) and Gnutzmann and Altland (2004) give lower and upper bounds for the border
of universality. For a recent review on quantum graphs see Kuchme nt (2002).
Quantum dynamics on graphs became an issue also in the context of q uantum information. Aharonov
et al(1993) pointed out that a random quantum walk on one dimensional c hains can be faster than
the corresponding classical random walk. Since then, a whole ﬁeld ha s emerged dealing with quantum
eﬀects on graphs with properties superiour to the corresponding classical operations. For an introductory
overview and further references, see Kempe (2003).
We will in the following give a general deﬁnition of quantum graphs and d iscuss a speciﬁc set-up
considered by Kottos and Smilansky (1997). We will then review rece nt developments on the spectral
statistics of quantum graph ensembles. Next, we discuss a special class of quantum graph ensembles, so-
called regular quantum graphs. These types of graphs can show st rong deviations from RMT depending
1
on topological properties imposed on the graph in form of edge-colo uring matrices. We will show that
such graphs can be interpreted as realisations of quantum random walks on graphs.
2 Quantum graphs - a brief review

In its most general form, a quantum graph is deﬁned in terms of a (ﬁ nite) graph Gtogether with a
unitary propagator U; it describes the dynamics of ”wavefunctions” φon the graph according to
φn+1=Uφn,
such that waves can propagate only between connected vertices . Motivated by physical application we
will adopt a construction of quantum graphs in terms of so-called line -graphs as explained below.
A (ﬁnite) directed graph ordigraphconsists of a ﬁnite set of verticesand a set of ordered pairs of
vertices called arcs. We denote by VGandEGthe set of vertices and arcs of the digraph G, respectively.
Given an ordering of the vertices, the adjacency matrix of a digraph Gonnvertices, denoted by AG, is
the (0,1)-matrix where the ij-th element is deﬁned by
AG
ij:=/braceleftbigg1 if (ij)∈EG,
0 otherwise.(1)
Anundirected graph (for short, graph) is a digraph whose adjacency matrix is symmetric. The undirected
connectionsbetweenverticesarecallededgesinthiscase. The line digraph ofadigraph G, denotedby LG,
is the graph which is obtained when taking the arcs as the new vertice s; it is thus deﬁned as VLG=EG
and, given ( hi),(jk)∈EG, the ordered pair (( hi)(jk))∈ELGif and only if i=j(Bang-Jensen and
Gutin 2001).
Aquantum graph associated with a digraph Gonnvertices can then be deﬁned in terms of a set of
unitary vertex scattering matrices σ(j)on vertices j= 1,...nand a set of arc lengths Lijdeﬁned for
every arc ( ij)∈EG. Waves propagate freely along the directed arcs, transitions bet ween incoming and
outgoing waves at a given vertex jare described by the scattering matrix σ(j), see Fig. 1a. The two sets
specify a unitary propagator of dimension nE=|EG|deﬁning transitions between arcs ( ij),(i′j′)∈EG
which has the form (Kottos and Smilansky 1997)
SG=DVwithD(ij)(i′j′)=δi,i′δj,j′eikLij, (2)
wherekis a wave number and
V(ij)(i′j′)=ALG
(ij)(i′j′)σ(j)
ij′withALG
(ij)(i′j′)=δj,i′. (3)
The local scattering matrices σ(i)describe the underlying physical process which may be derived from
boundary conditions on the vertices. We will construct an example b elow but may often regard the
σ(i)’s as arbitrary unitaries. Let d−
iandd+
ibe the number of incoming and outgoing arcs of a vertex
i, respectively. A suﬃcient and necessary condition for a digraph Gto be quantisable in the way above
is then, that for every vertex i∈VG,d+
i=d−
i=di= dimσ(i)(Pako´ nski et al2003). This means in
particular that if Gis an undirected graph then it is quantisable.
Kottos and Smilansky (1997) considered solving the 1d Schr¨ odinge r equation on an undirected graph
assuming free propagation on the arcs and imposing continuity and ﬂ ux conservation at the vertices. The
solution on each arc propagating from vertex i→jtakes on the form
φ(xij) =φ+
ijeikxij=φ−
ije−ik(Lij−xij),
withφ±
ijbeing the outgoing (+) or incoming ( −) wave at vertex iorj. Continuity and ﬂux conservation
can then be written in terms of the amplitudes φ+
ij(0) andφ−(Lij) at the vertices, that is

can be found in Kottos and Smilansky (1999).
The ”classical” dynamics corresponding to a quantum graph deﬁned by a unitary propagator SGis
given by a stochastic process with transition matrix Tdeﬁned by
SG→T(SG) with T(SG)ij=|SG
ij|2=|Vij|2. (6)
The matrix Tis clearly stochastic, as/summationtextnE
j=1Tij= 1 due to the unitary of SG; the set of transition
matrices related to a unitary matrix as deﬁned in (6) is a subset of th e set of all stochastic transition
matrices, referred to as the set of unitary-stochastic matrices. The topology of the set in the space of all
stochastic matrices is in fact quite complicated, see Pako´ nski et al(2001). In what follows, we will only
use that Thas a largest eigenvalue 1 with corresponding eigenvector1
nE(1,...,1) which follows from the
Frobenius-Perron theorem and Tbeing unitary-stochastic.
Note that both the quantum mechanics as well as the associated st ochastic dynamics relates to
transitions between arcs and is thus deﬁned on the line digraph of G.
2.2 Unitary stochastic ensembles and spectral statistics
Inspired by the BGS conjecture for quantum systems, we expect a link between the dynamical properties
of the stochastic process Tand the statistical properties of the spectrum of associated unit ary matrices
SG. It is thus natural to consider the ensemble of unitary matrices
USET0=/braceleftbig
SGis quantum graph on G|T(SG) =T0/bracerightbig
(7)

for a given graph Gand a ﬁxed unitary stochastic matrix T0associated with a stochastic process on the
line-graph of G. Clearly, if SG(k)∈USET0fork= 0 then it is for all k∈IR. In fact, if all the arc length
Lijare incommensurate, D(k) sweeps out the space of unitary diagonal matrices of dimension nE. For
practical purposes we will thus often replace averages over a give nUSETby averaging over the space of
diagonal unitary matrices DwithDij=δijeiϕjusing the Euclidean measure on the nE- torus.
Rather than looking at the spectrum obtained from the secular det erminant (5), we will here consider
the spectrum SGforﬁxed wavenumber kand than averageover k. One canwrite the spectrum in terms of
a periodic orbit trace formula reminiscent to the celebrate Gutzwiller trace formula being a semiclassical
approximation of the trace of the Green function (Gutzwiller 1990) . We write the density of states in
terms of the traces of SG, that is,

where the amplitudes give again transitions between arcs (not vert ices). An example of such a periodic
path is given in Fig. 1b.
Trace formulas like (8) are a starting point for analysing the statist ical properties of quantum spectra.
The statistical quantities such as the two-point correlation funct ion can be written in terms of the density
of states d(θ,N), that is,
R2(x) =1
d2< d(θ)d(θ+x/d)>USET,θ, (10)
whered=N/2πis the mean level density. The average is taken here over the angle θas well as over the
USE (which is equivalent to energy averaging). The Fourier coeﬃcien ts of (10) can be written in terms
of the traces of S; one obtains
K(τ) =<1
N|TrSNτ|2>USET (11)
withτ=n/Nand the average is taken over a USE. The so-called form factor K(τ) can thus be written
as a double sum over periodic paths on the graph

The ﬁrst term in (13), also called the diagonal term (Berry 1985), o riginates from periodic orbit pairs
(p,p′) related through cyclic permutations of the vertex symbol code. There are typically norbits of
that kind and all these orbits have the same amplitude Aand phase L. The corresponding periodic orbit

The linear terms are reproduced by the diagonal contribution which gives the important link between
the stochastic dynamics and the spectral statistics; it follows fro m limn→∞TrTn= 1 given there is a gap
between the leading and next-leading eigenvalue of T. Contributions to the double sum in (13) which
survive the ensemble average are due to periodic orbit pairs where o rbits visit the same arcs along its
path but in diﬀerent order. The simplest examples are ”ﬁgure eight” orbits of the type shown in Fig. 2
which arise in undirected graphs. Berkolaiko et al(2002) could indeed show that orbits of that type give
the correct O(τ2) - contributions to the GOE - form factor. In fact, a general sch eme emerges relating
O(τn) contributions to periodic orbits with nintersections. This work was inspired by a similar analysis
for general quantum systems by Sieber and Richter (2001). The p eriodic orbit contributions giving the
O(τ3) have been worked out by Berkolaiko et al(2003) and a general scheme for obtaining higher order
terms iteratively has been given by M¨ uller et al(2004).
2.3 Border of universality
In the light of these recent developments, it becomes important to establish the boundaries at which
the spectral statistics of quantum graph ensembles (or more gen eral quantum systems) starts to deviate
from random matrix behaviour. One can distinguish two diﬀerent sce narios. Firstly, the properties of
the underlying dynamics, that is, the stochastic process Tmay be linked to the spectral statistics and
may thus provide conditions for the onset of deviations from RMT be haviour; such an approach is in the
spirit of the original BGS - conjecture making a connection between classical chaos and random matrix
statistics. Secondly, one may consider special phase or length cor relations in the quantum graph which
could lead to interesting non-universal statistics; in this approach , quantum graph ensemble averages are
carried out only over subsets of the full USE.
We will discuss known bounds on the border of universality related to the properties of the stochastic
process. An interesting family of quantum graphs which belongs to t he second category are so-called
regular quantum graphs, which will be treated in more detail in sectio n 3.
Spectral gap conditions When studying the border of universality, we always need to conside r the
limit of large graphs, that is, nE→ ∞. This limit is in general not well deﬁned, but may often be
obvious from the examples considered. We will thus deﬁne the semicla ssical limit loosely via a family
of unitary-stochastic transition matrices {TnE}and associate USE’s and take nE→ ∞. The leading

term in (13) then gives a condition for a family to show deviations from RMT statistics in terms of the
spectrum of T; the diagonal term must obey

in order to match the leading coeﬃcient in the expansion of the RMT fo rm - factor; here ∆ is the spectral
gap, that is, ∆ = −log(1− |Λ1|) with Λ 1being the next to leading eigenvalue of TnE) andτ=n/nE
is ﬁxed. The condition above implies that we expect to see deviations f rom RMT behaviour to leading
order if
∆∼n−α
Ewithα >1,
that is, whenever the gap closes faster than 1 /nEfor large system sizes (Tanner 2001). Based on super-
symmetric techniques, Gnutzmann and Altland (2004) could give a low er bound by showing that the
spectral gap condition guaranteesRMT behaviour for α≤1/2. The border of universality must therefore
lie in the range 1 /2< α≤1. Other bounds have been given by Berkolaiko et al(2002,2003) which have
been derived from higher order terms in the expansion of the form f actor. Below we we will give two
examples families with α= 1 displaying critical behaviour by neither converging to RMT nor to P oisson
statistics in the semiclassical limit.
Quantum star-graphs: Quantum star-graphsarisenaturally when one quantisesa graphw ith a single
central vertex attached to nEundirected edges, see inset of Fig. 3a. The underlying graph is comp lete,
that is, we can reach every edge from every other edge through t he central vertex (ignoring the trivial
dynamics on the outer vertices). Typical boundary conditions impo sed on the wave equation at the
central vertex following Kottos and Smilansky’s approach in Sec. 2.1 yield scattering matrices which
greatly favour backscattering. The vertex scattering matrix (4 ) which is essentially equivalent to the
matrixShere is
Sij=−δij+2
nE. (14)
The Markov processes associated with quantum star graphs corr espond to systems of weakly coupled
edges. Its dynamical properties are determined by the spectrum of the stochastic matrix associated with
(14) which is highly degenerate and can be given explicitly (Kottos and Smilansky 1999), that is,
Λ0= 1,Λ1,...,ΛnE−1= (1−4
nE)≈4
nE.
Quantum star-graphs have therefore a critical classical spectr um with a spectral gap vanishing propor-
tional to 1 /nE; one ﬁnds indeed spectral statistics intermediate between Poisso n and COE statistics.
The two-point correlation function has been work out explicitly by Be rkolaiko et al(2001) and has
been shown to coincide with the statistics of so-called Seba billiards, t hat is, rectangular billiards with a
6
single ﬂux line. The ﬁrst few terms in a power series expansion of the f orm factor have been derived by
Kottos and Smilansky (1999) and Berkolaiko and Keating (1999) and yield
K(τ) =e−4τ+8τ332
3τ4+16
3τ5+..., (15)
see Fig. 3a.
Diﬀusive networks: The quantum mechanics of classically diﬀusive systems has been stud ied mainly
in the context of Anderson localisation and localisation-delocalisation transitions, see e.g. Dittrich (1996)
and Janssen (1998) for recent review articles.
As a simple example, we consider here a quantum graph correspondin g to a classical Markov process
on a regular lattice in ddimensions, see Fig. 3b for d= 2. Choosing a stochastic matrix Tdwith constant
transition probabilities tij= 1/2dbetween connected edges corresponds to d-dimensional diﬀusion in the
continuum limit L→ ∞; here,Lis the number of vertices along each direction, that is, the total nu mber
of arcs is nE= 2dLd. Solving the diﬀusion equation with periodic boundary conditions allows one to
recover the low lying part of the spectrum of Td, that is,
logΛm=−4π2D

that is, we expect universal statistics for d≥3 only. (Actually, the bound by Gnutzmann and Altland
(2004) guarantees random matrix statistics only for d≥4, numerics suggests however, that d= 3 follows
RMT already (Tanner 2001)). One ﬁnds convergence to the Poisso n limit due to Anderson localisation in
one dimension (Schanz and Smilansky 2000). The two-dimensional ca se is critical with ∆ ∼1/nEwhich
shows up in the form factor as a plateau for τ→0, that is, lim τ→0K(τ) = 1/4π, see Fig. 3b (Tanner
2002).
3 Regular quantum graphs
In the following, we will consider quantum graphs for which the above bounds do not necessarily hold
due to length correlations in the graphs, that is, averages are not taken over a full USE. We will actually
look at a speciﬁc set of such non-generic quantum graphs, namely q uantum graphs for which the global
propagator Sconsists of identical local scattering processes at every vertex . Such graphs have been
calledregular quantum graphs by Severini and Tanner (2004); the name derives from the notatio nregular
graphsfor graphs which have the same number of incoming and outgoing arc s at every vertex and thus
share the property that vertices are locally indistinguishable. We will show that regular quantum graphs
corresponding to the same underlying graph Gcan behave very diﬀerently depending on how the local
scattering processes are connected to each other. We will show t hat a crucial element in this is played by
the possible ways regular graphs can be edge-coloured. Regular gr aphs are in fact another way at looking
atquantum random walks as will be pointed out at the end of this section.
3.1 Regular quantum graphs and edge-colouring matrices
We will construct a quantum graph on a d-regular digraph Gwithnvertices for which the wave dynamics
at a given vertex of the graph is ”locally indistinguishable” from that o f any other vertex of the graph.

This is done by choosing a unitary d-dim. matrix σand a set of arc-lengths Li,i= 1,...dand ascribing
the scattering process σto every vertex in the graph with incoming as well as outgoing arcs ch osen from
the set of Li’s at every vertex. This is done here by ﬁrst ﬁxing a so-called edge-colouring of the graph
(see eg Bollob´ as 1979), that is, we assign one of ddiﬀerent ”colours” to every directed arc of the graph
in such a way that no vertex has two incoming or two outgoing arcs of the same colour. Note that there
are many diﬀerent ways to edge-colour a given regular graph for d≥2. Edge-colouring can be described
in terms of a set of n- dimensional permutation matrices ρi,i= 1,...dhaving the property that

withAGbeing the adjacency matrix of G; the arc ( ij) is then assigned the colour kif the (ij) matrix
element of ρkis non-zero. We refer to the set of ρi’s as the edge-colouring matrices ofG1. In Fig. 4, an
explicit example is shown with

in the next section; this is in contrast to the representations of th e line-graph adjacency matrix (18)
which are all equivalent up to relabeling the arcs in the graph. For mod iﬁcations of this construction for
undirected graphs with time reversal symmetry, see Severine and Tanner (2004).
3.2 From ’integrable’ to ’chaotic’ regular quantum graphs - some examples
In this section, we will show that diﬀerent ways to edge-colour a gra ph can indeed lead to very diﬀerent
types of quantum graphs with spectral statistics ranging from Po isson to CUE. In other words, in regular
quantum graphs it is the choice of the edge-colouring matrices ρi, a purely topological quantity, which
determines the properties of the quantum graph independent of t he single vertex scattering processes
given through the coin C. We will demonstrate this here for a speciﬁc example, namely so called complete
graphsG=Knwith adjacency matrix AG=Jn, that is every vertex is connected to every other vertex,
see Fig. 5. (Note that nE=n2, here). A more general treatment can be found in Severini and Ta nner
(2004). In the examples discussed below, we make use of the fact t hat for ﬁnite groups Γ of order n, we
may write
n/summationdisplay
i=1ρi=Jn. (20)
where the ρi’s form a regular representation of Γ. In what follows we will study va rious decompositions
ofJnand see how they eﬀect statistical properties of the spectra of q uantum graphs.
3.3 The cyclic group Zn
We will ﬁrst consider an abelian group, namely the cyclic group Zn. Theρi’s forming a regular repre-
sentation commute with each other and are of the form
(ρj)kl=δk,(l+j)modnwith eigenvalues χj
m=e2πijm
n,where j,m= 1,...,n.
The abelian nature of the group allows one to block-diagonalise the ma trixSGintonblocks of dimension
neach, independent of the coin C. The spectrum of the quantum graph is then given by the spectra o f
the sub-matrices
SG
m=
n/circleplusdisplay
j=1e2πijm
n
·Cwithm= 1,...,n.
The eigenvalues of SGare here characterised in terms of two quantum numbers, an ’angu lar momentum’
quantum number mand a second quantum number counting the eigenvalues in each mmanifold. If the
spectra for diﬀerent mare uncorrelated, one expects Poisson statistics of the total sp ectrum in the limit
n→ ∞.
Figure 6a) shows spectral properties of SGwithn= 24, that is, dim SG= 576. We plot here the
nearest neighbour spacing (NNS) distribution P(s) and the form factor K(τ). The coin is of the from
9
C(k) =D(k)σwhere the local scatteringmatrix σis choosen to be the Fourier matrix and the arclengths
entering the diagonalmatrix Dare chosen independently and identically distributed in [0 ,1]. The average
is, for a ﬁxed choice of the coin, taken by averaging over the wavele ngthk. The numerical results are
shown in Fig. 6a) and suggest indeed Poisson-statistics apart form deviations in the form factor on scales
τ≤1/ndue to the ‘random nature’ of the coin.
3.4 The non-abelian case: the symmetric group S4
Next, we consider a speciﬁc example of a non-abelian group, namely t he symmetric group S4withn= 24
elements. By writing the permutation matrices ρiforming the regular representation of S4in terms
of the irreducible representations (for short irreps) ofS4, we can again give the propagator SK24in
block-diagonal form where the blocks are now of size nd, withdbeing the dimension of the irrep under
consideration. The group S4has 2 one-dimensional, 1 two-dimensional and 2 three-dimensional ir reps,
and each d- dimensional irrep is contained dtimes in each ρiaccording to the general formula
2·11+1·22+2·33= 24.
We thus have 5 independent sub-spectra making up the spectrum o f the quantum graph SGof which two
are of dimension n= 24, one is of dimension 2 ·24 = 48 and two are of dimension 3 ·24 = 72; the latter
once are two and three times degenerate, respectively. The huge degeneracy in the spectra can clearly be
seen in the spectral statistics; it is manifest in the peak at s= 0 inP(s), see Fig. 6b, and leads to
K(τ) = (2·33+1·23+2·13) = 8/3 for τ >3/24.
The spectra appear to be uncorrelated otherwise; note however , that the spectrum for each sub-block
alone are correlated following CUEstatistics, which gives rise to the deviations from purely Poisson
behaviour in P(s) (cf. dashed curve) as well as in the behaviour of the form factor forτ≤3/24 which is
dominated by the sub-spectra of the three dimensional irreps.
3.5 The generic case: no symmetries
The overwhelming number of decompositions of the form (20) will of c ourse have no common symmetry,
that is, it is not possible to block-diagonalise the ρi’s simultaneously. We therefore do not expect any
special features in the spectrum. The question remains, however , if the ’randomness’ put into the system
by choosing a random edge-colouring is enough to produce generic, random matrix type, statistics. After
all, these quantum graphs still possess a large degree of degenera cy due to the presence of identical coins
at every vertex. A numerical study may thus reveal interesting in sights into the range of validity of the
RMT - regime. Fig. 6c shows the level statistics for an unstructure d choice of edge-colouring matrices
which is in good agreement with random matrix theory for the CUE - en semble2. Note that the statistic
has been obtained from the spectrum on an ( n2×n2) unitary matrix which has only n3non-zeroelements
of which only n2are independent; in addition, there are only ndiﬀerent arcs lengths to choose from for
n2diﬀerent arcs. The origin of the universality in the spectral statist ics in this type of quantum graphs
is here clearly not due to the ’randomness’ in the choice of the matrix elements but due to random
edge-colouring of the graph alone!
3.6 Quantum random walks
In recent years, the study of unitary propagation on graphs has also been looked at from the perspective
of devising a quantum version of a random walk. This line of thought ar ose as part of the eﬀort to
build quantum information systems being able to do operations which a re impossible or much slower on
classical devices. It could indeed be shown that quantum random wa lks have this property under certain
2Deviations in the formfactor for small τcan be attributed to the fact that the spectrum of Citself is always contained
in the full spectrum, see Severini and Tanner (2004); this pa rt has been removed in the NNS statistic.

11
circumstances: quantum walks can be faster for some network ge ometries (Aharonov et al1993) and can
even lead to an exponential speed-up such as for the graph-trav ersal algorithm by Childs et al(2003);
for an introductory overview and further references, see Kemp e (2003). The generalisation of Grover’s
algorithm (Grover 1997) to spatial searches on graphs (Shenvi et al2003, Ambianis et al2004, Childs
and Goldstone 2004) is another remarkable recent result.
We will not study the properties of quantum random walks here; inst ead, we would like to point
out that the discrete quantum walk modules discussed in the literatu re are in fact equivalent to regular
quantum graphs such as introduced in the previous sections.
In brief, a discrete quantum random walk comprises of an in general d- regular graph Gwithn
vertices (where lattices are favoured in the literature) and a ’spin’ degree of freedom, where the spin
can take up ddiﬀerent states. A quantum state at a vertex vwith spin iis then described by |v,i >
and the quantum wave function is a superposition of all possible vert ex states. The quantum random
walk consists of a ’walk’ element and a ’quantum coin toss’. The walk is st eered by the internal spin
states, that is, there exist matrices ρi,i= 1,...dwhich deﬁne in which direction the component |v,i >
is ﬂowing, that is,
ρi|v,i >=|v′,i >
where the internal spin states remains unchanged. The ρi’s are obviously permutation matrices in the
vertex space. The coin toss is simulated by applying a unitary transf ormation Cto the spin states at
every vertex, that is,
C|v,i >=|v,/summationdisplay
jCijj >;
the coin is unbiased, if |Cij|2= 1/dthroughout. It is clear from the construction, that one obtains a
classical random walk on such a network, if one performs a measure ment after every walk by projecting
out the spin degrees of freedom.
A full cycle of walk and coin toss is then described by a unitary matrix
SQW=/parenleftiggd/circleplusdisplay
i=1ρi/parenrightigg
·(C⊗In) (21)
which has exactly the form of the propagator for regular quantum graphs in Eq. (19). We thus identify
theρi’s with the edge-colouring matrices and the coin is in fact a local scatt ering matrix. Writing the
components of the wave function in |v,i >notation is thus just a diﬀerent way of labeling the arcs in the
graph and the dynamics takes indeed place on the line-digraph of G.
To demonstrate the mechanism, let us give a speciﬁc example: the qu antum walk on an inﬁnite line.
A popular setting is the following walk:
states: |i,↑>,|i,↓>, i∈Z
walk:|i,↑>→ |i+1,↑>
|i,↓>→ |i−1,↓>,that is, ρ↑=δi,i+1, ρ↓=δi,i−1;
coin: C=1√
2/parenleftbigg1 1
−1 1/parenrightbigg
.
A random walk starting in the state |i,↑>then evolves according to
|i,↑>C→1√
2(|i,↑>−|i,↓>)walk→(|i+1,↑>−|i−1,↓>)C→... .
Continuing this process leads quickly to a probability proﬁle which grow s linearly with the number of
stepstwhich is in contrast to the classical spreading for 1d random walks be ing of the order√
t(Kempe
2003). It must be pointed out, however, that this is a pure symmet ry eﬀect due the choice of edge-
colouring matrices; in the setting chosen here, the two operations ρ↑andρ↓commute. By introducing
12
disorder into the quantum random walk on a line by for example random ly switching the shift operation
at every vertex leads to a completely diﬀerent behaviour resembling that of a quantum graph on a diﬀu-
sive network as discussed in sec. 2.3.
