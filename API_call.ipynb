    "# arXiv API Search Query Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "The `search_query` parameter in the arXiv API allows you to specify search criteria for retrieving articles. It enables you to define a query string that determines which articles will be returned in the API response. Here's how the `search_query` parameter works:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use keywords to search for articles that contain specific terms or phrases. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "search_query = \"quantum physics\"\n",
    "This retrieves articles that contain the keywords \"quantum\" and \"physics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Field-Specific Searches\n",
    "You can specify which fields of the articles to search within. Some common fields include:\n",
    "\n",
    "all: Searches for keywords in all fields of the articles, including the title, author names, abstract, and more.\n",
    "title: Searches for keywords only in the titles of articles.\n",
    "author: Searches for articles authored by specific authors or containing specific author names.\n",
    "abstract: Searches for keywords in the abstracts of articles.\n",
    "category: Searches for articles within specific categories or subjects.\n",
    "Boolean Operators\n",
    "You can use Boolean operators to refine your search. Common operators include:\n",
    "\n",
    "AND: Retrieves articles that contain both specified terms. For example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "search_query = \"quantum AND physics\"\n",
    "This retrieves articles related to both quantum and physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "OR: Retrieves articles that contain either of the specified terms. For example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "search_query = \"quantum OR physics\"\n",
    "This retrieves articles related to quantum or physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOT: Excludes articles that contain the specified term. For example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "search_query = \"quantum NOT physics\"\n",
    "This retrieves articles related to quantum but not physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wildcards\n",
    "You can use wildcards to match partial terms or patterns. Common wildcards include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*: Matches any sequence of characters. For example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "search_query = \"astro*\"\n",
    "This retrieves articles related to astrophysics, astronomy, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "?: Matches a single character. For example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "search_query = \"colou?r\"\n",
    "This retrieves articles related to \"color\" or \"colour.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact Phrases\n",
    "You can use double quotes to search for an exact phrase. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "search_query = \"\\\"quantum mechanics\\\"\"\n",
    "This retrieves articles with the exact phrase \"quantum mechanics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Parentheses\n",
    "You can use parentheses to group terms and control the order of operations. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "search_query = \"(quantum OR physics) AND NOT chemistry\"\n",
    "This retrieves articles related to quantum or physics but not chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Field Prefixes\n",
    "You can specify the field to search within by using field prefixes. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "search_query = \"title:quantum\"\n",
    "This searches for the term \"quantum\" only in article titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search_query parameter allows you to construct complex queries to narrow down the search results based on your specific requirements and interests. You can combine various operators, fields, and keywords to tailor your search query to find relevant articles on arXiv."
